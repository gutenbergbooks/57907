<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Somáliland, the new British Protectorate, is in some
respects one of the most interesting regions of the African
Continent. In the present daily life of its natives we
have represented to us something of the wandering
patriarchal existence of Biblical times. The country
contains ruins which probably date back to a period of
very ancient civilisation. It is, moreover, the threshold
to the mysterious nomad Gálla tribes who inhabit the land
between the Gulf of Aden and the Great African Lakes.
Somáliland is the home of most varieties of African large
game, and affords one of the best and most accessible
of hunting-grounds to be found at the present time.</p>

<p>In the intervening years, between 1884 and 1893,
professional duties necessitated my undertaking several
journeys in Somáliland, with the object of exploration.
In the intervals between these journeys I devoted my
periods of leave to hunting in that country. During
a period of nine years I undertook seventeen separate
journeys to the interior, and so became familiar with the
chief elements of interest to be found there. At the
outset of my travels my age was twenty-five. I enjoyed
absolute freedom of movement, and at this period had
full control of a small escort of Indian cavalry. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
sense of responsibility, and the prospect of exploring
new country, filled me with delight and awakened my
faculties. When I first entered the interior of Somáliland,
in 1885, it was practically an untraversed country;
and hitherto, though unjustly so, it had always borne the
reputation of being the desert home of bigoted and
ferocious savages.</p>

<p>My principal object in writing this book is to present
phases of life in nomadic North-East Africa, and to
supply detailed information of a nature that might prove
useful to travellers and sportsmen who wish to visit that
country. As my brother and I have always been
pioneering, the men who have followed in our footsteps
have naturally had better opportunities for sport than
we had, and I only give such of my more successful
sporting experiences as will assist me in my main object
of giving a general portrait of the country.</p>

<p>With reference to the following pages of my book, I
would say that I merely present a collection of facts. To
write a continuous narrative of my movements, in a
manner to hold the interest of the reader throughout,
requires a special literary gift such as I do not possess.
The careful notes of all that came within the observation
and experience of my brother and myself, during our
ten thousand miles of wanderings with camel caravans,
are here collected and presented in their most simple
form. Most of the illustrations are direct reproductions
of my own drawings, representing incidents I have seen,
for the artistic merit of which I must beg my readers’
indulgence.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Brigadier-General J. Jopp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
C.B., A.D.C., British Resident at Aden; and to Lieut.-Colonel
E. V. Stace, C.B., Political Agent and Consul
for the Somáli Coast; and to many officers of the Aden
Political Staff under whom I have been employed, or
with whom I have been associated, for many kindnesses
and hospitalities extended to me in Aden and the Somáli
Coast ports; and to my brother, Captain E. J. E. Swayne,
16th Bengal Infantry, for the use of his journals and
sketches, for all his valuable and indefatigable assistance,
to say nothing of his saving my life in a plucky and
skilful manner under circumstances the difficulty of
which only sportsmen can fully appreciate. My best
thanks are also due to Prince Boris Czetwertynski and
Mr. Seton Karr for having given me permission to
reproduce some of their beautiful and artistic photographs;
to Captain H. M. Abud, Assistant Resident at
Aden, for many hospitalities, and for his kindness in
having supplied me with the historical notes given in the
first chapter.</p>

<p>I am also greatly indebted to Lieut.-General E. F.
Chapman, C.B., Director of Military Intelligence, and to
Lieut.-Colonel J. K. Trotter, and other officers of the
Intelligence Staff, for having permitted me to use and
to copy a reduction of my routes, which was made under
their direction; and also to Mr. W. Knight for the excellent
manner in which he has designed and drawn the
maps which accompany this book. My third chapter
is rewritten from articles which have already been
published in the <cite>Field</cite> in 1887, and I have to thank the
Editor of that paper for his courtesy in having allowed
me to make use of them here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>I have to thankfully acknowledge the kindness of Dr.
P. L. Sclater, Secretary of the London Zoological Society,
for having permitted me to rewrite and amplify, in my
supplementary chapter, two papers upon Antelopes which
were written by me for that Society and published in its
<cite>Proceedings</cite>.</p>

<p>Finally, I would express my gratitude to Mr. Rowland
Ward, who has devoted so much valuable time and experience
to the production of my book.</p>

<p class="center smaller">“He who dines alone, dines with the devil.”—<i>Somáli proverb.</i></p>

<p>The inhabitants of Somáliland may be divided into four
separate classes:—The nomad Somális, who keep sheep, goats,
cattle, and camels, and who breed ponies; who live almost
entirely upon milk and meat, and follow the rains in search of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
grass for their animals. The settled Somális, who form a comparatively
small community, living in or near the coast towns,
and who are principally occupied as <i>abbáns</i> or brokers. Certain
outcaste races, living in a precarious way, scattered about among
the different Somáli tribes, engaged principally gathering gum
and hunting. The traders, who bring large caravans from the
interior to the coast at certain seasons.</p>

<p>The most important trading caravans are those which come
to Berbera from Ogádén and Harar. They bring hides, ivory,
ostrich feathers, rhinoceros and antelope horns, prayer-skins,
honey, coffee, ghee (clarified butter), and gum; exchanging these
products and loading up for the return journey with the beads,
dates, rice, cotton goods, and other articles which form the
cargoes of dhows visiting the ports. The traders have portable
huts (<i>gurgi</i>) which are packed on the camels, and can be pitched
or struck in about an hour. These they erect on long halts,
and when staying at the coast towns in the trading season.
The <i>rer</i> or kraal (<i>karia</i> in Arabic) is formed by unpacking
the <i>gurgi</i> and pitching them in a semicircle, surrounding the
whole by a thorn fence or zeríba. The huts are carried on
camels in sections, and consist of a framework of bent gipsy
poles, over which mats and skins are sewn when a halt is made.
While on the march the mats do duty as packsaddles for the
camels, the skins being tied over the loads to protect them from
sun and rain. While the caravans are at the coast, generally
during the greater part of the cold weather, the camels are
placed under the care of the nomad Somális, to be fed and
tended until the return journey to the interior in the spring.</p>

<p>The nomadic tribes also form zeríbas during their constant
wanderings, staying in camp for a month or two at a time.
Each nomad clan wanders in an orbit of its own, and reoccupies
its former zeríbas at the different pastures year after year.
Their zeríbas differ from those of trading caravans by being
made in a double ring, the outer circle of which is often twelve
feet high, to keep out lions. Inside the double brushwood
fence the space is divided into pens for cattle, camels, sheep,
and goats, the ponies being hobbled and allowed to graze abroad
by day, while at night they are tied to the outside of the huts
or to thorn trees, and for their further protection fires are lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
round the inside of the zeríba and in the huts. At the coast
towns the arrangements are not so formidable, a low single fence
to keep in the animals being deemed sufficient. The huts are
put up by women, while the men form the zeríba and cut logs
for the watch-fires, using an axe (<i>fás</i>) consisting of a block of soft
iron, worked into a ring with a forked stick inserted—much like
the axe of jungle tribes in India. The men are extremely lazy,
and consider that their dignity is lowered by tending anything
but camels, cattle, and ponies. Thousands of sheep and goats
are looked after by a few women and small children; while
the donkeys and water-vessels which they carry are the
particular care of the oldest and most decrepit women.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of nomad encampments and watering
places is always noisy and dusty, the ground being worked into
powder by the feet of thousands of animals. Most of the bushes
are denuded of their branches for firewood, and the grass is
eaten and worn away. At the important wells watering is
done by sub-tribes, to each of which is allotted a certain well at
a certain hour. When watering is going on, the groups of
naked men singing in chorus as they pass the water up to the
troughs, the lowing of the cattle, the countless flocks and herds
moving to and fro half veiled by clouds of dust, go to form a
very remarkable scene. The nomads who live about the Gólis
Range draw near to the coast during the cool trading season,
and return to the high Ogo country to remain there during the
summer months. They form no large caravans, but are engaged
in a good deal of petty barter with the coast and in the export
of sheep.</p>

<p>With reference to the class engaged in brokerage, they are
people settled permanently at the ports of the North Somáli
coast. Until a short time ago the office of <i>abbán</i> or broker was
considered to be important. When a trader arrived off the
coast in a dhow, or with a caravan from the interior, he was
obliged to engage an <i>abbán</i> to transact his business, to protect
his interests, to act as general agent, paying in return for such
services a small commission on all purchases and sales.</p>

<p>Of the outcaste races the most important are the Tomal,
Yebir, and Midgán. They are not organised in tribes, but live
in scattered families all over Somáliland. The Tomal are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the blacksmiths, who fashion all kinds of arms, axes, and
general ironwork. The Yebir are workers in leather, such as
saddlery, scabbards, and so forth. The Midgáns are probably
the most numerous of the outcaste people. They are armed
with the <i>mindi</i> (a small dagger), bow, and poisoned arrows,
carrying the latter in a large quiver. They keep wild and
savage pariah dogs, which they train to hunting, their chief
quarry being the oryx (<i>Oryx beisa</i>), the large bovine antelope
with the rapier-like horns.</p>

<p>I have often been out oryx-hunting on foot in the Bulhár
Plain with Midgáns and dogs. When a bull oryx is killed a
disc from fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter is cut from the
thick skin of his withers and sometimes from the rump: these
are worth from one to four rupees at the coast, and are used
by the Midgáns for making shields. The Midgáns are a hardy
race, used to living away from karias, stealthy and perfect
trackers, and they are sometimes, in intertribal warfare, engaged
to act as messengers, scouts, and light skirmishers. There
appears to be no physical difference between them and other
Somális, except that the average stature of the Midgáns may
be slightly shorter. I have on more than one occasion come
upon a party of Midgáns pegging out the fresh skin of a lion
which they had just killed; many of these animals are brought
to bag every year with no other weapons than their tiny arrows.
The lions are found asleep under the <i>khansa</i> bushes at midday,
or are shot from an ambush at night over a living bait, or when
returning to a “kill.”</p>

<p>In the interior of Northern Somáliland there are no
permanent settlements except those founded and occupied by
religious Mahomedans, called sheikhs, mullahs, or widads. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
settlements occur, on an average, about seventy miles apart.
The two largest which I have seen are Seyyid Mahomed’s
Town in Ogádén, and Hargeisa in the Habr Awal country.
There are about a dozen others of minor importance, all
inhabited by mullahs, scattered over several degrees of latitude
and longitude, and Hargeisa may be taken as the type of them
all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Mullahs are enabled to settle down and form permanent
villages, and cultivate, on account of the respect in which they
are held by all tribes. A looting party must be driven to the
last extremity of hunger before it will attack them, and generally
in such a case only as many animals would be looted as are
needed to provide food. The mullahs are drawn from various
tribes, and being cosmopolitan, have very extended influence.
They are a quiet, respectable class, generally on the side of
order, and are civil to travellers.</p>

<p>Hargeisa, a compact village of a few hundred <i>agal</i> or
permanent huts, is surrounded by a high mat fence, and a
square mile or two of <i>jowári</i> (<i>Holcus sorghum</i>) cultivation
belonging to different mullahs. Sheikh Mattar, the chief of
Hargeisa, is a pleasant mannered man affecting Arab dress; he
reads and writes Arabic, and is a steady supporter of British
interests. Like many of the more important mullahs in
Somáliland he has a very dark complexion, almost black, in
fact, with well-formed, intelligent features. With the exception
of these mullah settlements, a few graves dotted about the
country, and some cairns and ancient remains of former races,
there is nothing permanent to show the presence of human
beings. The caravan tracks are mere paths made by the feet
of camels and passing flocks, crossed by game tracks in every
direction. For countless years long lines of baggage camels
have gone aside from the straight course in order to wind round
some stone or bush that a child could remove. The work is
left to the next caravan, or to Allah, who is made responsible
for everything, good or bad, in Somáliland. There is no
social system, but patriarchal government by tribes, clans, and
families; no cohesion, and no paramount authority; and the
whole country has been from time immemorial in a chronic
state of petty warfare and blood feuds.</p>

<p>The Somáli has a many-sided character. He is generally
a good camelman, a cheerful camp-follower, a trustworthy,
loyal, and attentive soldier; proud of the confidence reposed
in him, quick to learn new things, and wonderfully bright and
intelligent. He is untiring on the march, and he is often a
reckless hunter, and will stand by his master splendidly. I
know of one Somáli who, to save his English master, hit a lion
over the head with the butt of his rifle; and quite lately, under
similar circumstances, another Somáli caught hold of a lion by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the jaws. Occasionally, however, he relapses into a state of
original sin; he becomes criminally careless with the camels,
breaking everything in the process of loading, from leather to
cast steel; he can be disrespectful, mutinous, and sulky. He
is inordinately vain, and will walk off into the jungle and make
his way home to the coast, leaving two months’ back pay
and rations behind him, if he considers his lordly dignity
insulted. If he sees a chance of gain he is a toady and
flatterer. His worst fault is avarice.</p>

<p>The Somáli, although by no means a coward, is much more
afraid of his fellow-man than of wild animals,—a fact which is
possibly due to the general insecurity of life and property.
Above all things he dreads crossing the frontiers of his country,
holding his hereditary enemies the Gállas in great abhorrence.
He has a great deal of romance in his composition, and
in his natural nomad state, on the long, lazy days, when there
is no looting to be done, while his women and children are away
minding his flocks, he takes his praying-mat and water-bottle,
and sits a hundred yards from his karia under a flat, shady
<i>gudá</i> tree, lazily droning out melancholy-sounding chants
on the themes of his dusky loves, looted or otherwise; on the
often miserable screw which he calls <i>faras</i>, the horse; and on
the supreme pleasure of eating stolen camels.</p>

<p>The summer and winter rains are his great periods of
activity. There is then plenty of grass, and pools of water
are abundant throughout the country; and he bestrides his
“favourite mare,” and in company with many dear brothers of
his clan, leaving his flocks and herds in the charge of his women
and young children, he rides quietly off a hundred miles into
the heart of the jungle to loot the camels of the next Somáli
tribe, the owners of which are perhaps away doing exactly the
same thing elsewhere. There is tremendous excitement, and
the camels are driven across miles of uninhabited wilderness,
trailing clouds of dust behind them; and so back to the home
karia, where he finds his own herds have perhaps been looted
in his absence. He at once goes off on a fresh horse, smarting
under his wrongs and intent on vengeance; and if in the spear
and shield skirmish that ensues a man has been killed, he
and his companions ride back covered with sweat and glory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the tired nags showing gaping spear wounds and mouths
dripping with blood from the cruel bit. This is life! In the
intervals between expeditions the Somális, when not sleeping,
sit in circles on the outskirts of their karias, talking, drinking
camel’s milk, and eating mutton, and doing nothing else for
days together. Every adult male has his say in the affairs of
the tribe, and is to a certain extent a born orator.</p>

<p>Somális are Mussulmans of the Shafai sect, and use the
Somáli salutation “<i>Nabad</i>” or the Arab “<i>Salaam aleikum</i>,”
which is answered by “<i>Aleikum salaam</i>” and touching of
hands. The men are nearly all dressed alike, in long “tobes”
of white sheeting of different degrees of dirtiness, from brown
to dazzling white; and not a few of the tobes have been dipped
in red clay and are of a bright burnt-sienna colour, making the
wearers look like Burmese priests. A long dagger (<i>biláwa</i>) is
strapped round the waist, while a shield and two spears are
carried in the hands. A grass water-bottle and Ogádén prayer-carpet
are slung over the shoulders of some, and on the feet
are thick sandals, turned up in front, and changed every hour
or so to ease the feet. Many of the men wear a leather charm
containing a verse of the Koran, a lump of yellow amber, or a
long prayer chaplet (<i>tusba</i>) of black sweet-smelling wood around
the neck. The camels are often adorned with cowrie necklaces.</p>

<p>The tobe is a simple cotton sheet of two breadths sewn
together, about fifteen feet long, and is worn in a variety of
ways. Generally it is thrown over one or both shoulders, a
turn given round the waist, and allowed to fall to the ankles.
In cold weather the head is muffled up in it after the fashion of
an Algerian “burnouse.” When sleeping round a camp fire the
body is enveloped in it from head to foot, as in a winding-sheet;
for a fight the chest and arms are left bare, the part
which was thrown over the shoulders being wound many times
round the waist to protect the stomach. In the jungle the
tobes are worn till they are brown and threadbare; but at the
coast towns they are generally of dazzling whiteness. Elders,
horsemen, and those who wish to assume a little extra dignity,
discard the common tobe and affect the <i>khaili</i>, a gorgeous
tartan arrangement in red, white, and blue, each colour being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
in two shades, with a narrow fringe of light yellow. On horseback
it is a very becoming dress, and it is often affected by a
favourite wife. All <i>khaili</i> tobes are about the same in appearance,
so that practically the white tobe or <i>khaili</i>, shield, and
spears, is a uniform that seldom varies much in the whole
country. There is very little distinction in the dress of different
tribes. The Esa seldom wear the tobe, having only a small
cloth hung round the loins. The Dolbahanta, Ogádén, Esa,
and the Ishák<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> tribes differ from one another in the shape of
their spear-blades; and the Midgáns carry bow and quiver
instead of spear and shield. The <i>biláwa</i> or sword is a long
two-edged, sharp-pointed knife with soft wrought iron blade,
about two feet long and an inch broad at the broadest part;
the weight is well forward for hacking. The hilt, too small for
an European hand, is made of horn, ornamented with zinc or
pewter, and the scabbard is of white leather, sewn crossways to
a long white thong which goes round the waist. The <i>gáshán</i>
or shield is a round disc of white leather, of rhinoceros, bullock,
or preferably oryx hide, from fifteen to eighteen inches in
diameter, with a boss in the centre and a handle behind. It
is easily pierced by a pistol bullet. Two kinds of spears are
used throughout the country, each man among the Ishák tribes,
near Berbera, carrying one of each kind. The small spear,
plain or barbed like a fish-hook, is for throwing at a distance of
from twenty-five to thirty yards, but the aim is not accurate
much over thirty yards, though I have seen it thrown as far as
seventy-five yards on foot in competitions at Bulhár. The
Somáli grasps his spear firmly in the fingers, and gives it one
or two quick jerks against the palm of the hand before casting,
the vibration being supposed to keep the point straight when
in flight. The best spear-shafts come from Eilo, a mountain
in the Gadabursi country near Zeila, and round the butt is
twisted a bit of soft iron to balance the spear-head. The
ponderous laurel-leaf shaped spear, bound with brass wire, is
used for close quarters, being especially useful against horses.
The men of the Esa tribe generally carry one of these and no
throwing spear. They fight on foot and charge home, stabbing
at close quarters, while most Somális prefer light skirmishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Some spears are scraped bright, others are blackened and
polished. The Somáli is often a great dandy in these matters,
and keeps his shield in a white calico cover.</p>

<p>The water-bottle (<i>karúra</i>) is a wonderfully neat affair, plaited
by the women from the fibres of a root, or from grass, and
made watertight by applying fat or other substances to the
inside, and is corked with a wooden plug. The prayer-carpet
generally comes from Ogádén, and is a small piece of very
thick tanned leather. On this the Somáli makes his regular
prostrations at dawn and sunset, and during the day, as becomes
a devout Mussulman, and when not put to this use, it is hung
over the shoulder to afford protection from the chafing of the
spears. The sandals are very heavy; they are of several
thicknesses of white leather, sewn together, rising in a knob in
front. They make a great noise, so when stalking game the
wearer carries them and goes barefoot. The club or kerrie is
a foot and a half long, made of the hard <i>wogga</i> wood, and is
thrown with dexterity.</p>

<p>Somális have generally good Arab features, with particularly
smooth skins, varying from the colour of an Arab to black.
Among certain tribes those who have killed a man wear an
ostrich feather in the hair. Originally it was only worn for
enemies killed in a fight, but now this is not always necessary.
Little boys carry miniature spears and shields as soon as they
can learn to use them, and many an Esa youth of sixteen can
show an ostrich feather which has been earned in the orthodox
manner.</p>

<p>The hair is worn in various ways according to sex and age.
Old men shave the head, and sometimes grow a slight beard.
Men in the prime of life wear their hair about an inch and a
half long, and periodically smear it with a gray mixture,
apparently composed of ashes and clay, leaving it for a day or
two to dry. It is then dusted out and the hair becomes
beautifully clean and highly curled. My followers have always
gone through this performance a day or two before reaching
Berbera at the conclusion of a trip. Young men and boys
grow their hair in a heavy mop, often of a yellow colour, like
the mane of a lion. Married women wear it in a chignon,
enclosed in a dark blue bag. Young women and girls wear a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
mop like the young men, but carefully plaited into pigtails.
Small children have their heads shaven, three cockscombs of
short hair being left, giving the skull the appearance of a
crested helmet.</p>

<p>Women are of very little account among the Somális, every
small boy appearing to lord it over the female members of his
family, of whatever generation. The father of many daughters
is rich in that while they are young they herd his sheep and
goats, and when they marry he receives from the husband of
each her <i>yerad</i> or price, in return for which he has to provide
a new hut and furniture for the pair. When a man marries he
pays the father of the woman, say, two or three horses and
about two hundred sheep. Often this is given back to the
woman by her father, and sometimes a dowry is given by him.
In the Rer Ali tribe we once passed a drove of about fifty
camels being driven by a pretty young woman, who stopped to
proudly tell us that they were her dowry, which her father was
sending along with her to her husband. One favourite way of
obtaining a wife is to loot her in a foray, along with a lot of
sheep. Often when I have asked a man where he got his
pretty wife, he has answered, “Oh, I looted her from the
Samanter Abdallah,” or the Rer Ali, naming a neighbouring
tribe. A nod and a laugh from the wife has corroborated the
story, and she does not appear to be at all unhappy about it.
Marriage with aliens is, I think, looked upon with favour by
Somális, because it brings new blood into the tribe; and it has
the additional advantage of extending diplomatic relations, a
man who has married into a tribe being tolerably safe when in
its territory, even in disturbed times.</p>

<p>Some rich women, who have brought a large dowry to their
husbands, only perform light work in the huts, and make mats.
Others tend sheep and cattle, draw water, hew wood, and work
all day long, with no reward but blows. I go by what Somális
themselves say, for I have never seen any cruelty to support
the statement. Women work very hard. From every watering-place
old women are seen struggling to the karias with heavy
<i>háns</i> full of water, often containing three or four gallons.
They carry the <i>háns</i> and bundles of firewood in exactly the
same manner as they do their babies, slung on their backs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The water <i>háns</i> are composed of plaited bark. They are easily
broken, and on every march one or two may become useless,
owing either to contact with thorn branches or to the tired
camels sitting on them. A little water must always be lost by
slight leakage. My own experience of <i>háns</i> has been somewhat
unfortunate, chiefly because my caravans being composed
almost entirely of men, their
management has not been
properly understood.</p>

<p>Another industry practised
by the women is the plaiting
of camel-mats; these are made
by chewing the stripped bark
of the <i>Galol</i> tree, weaving it
into a mat, which it takes
them a week to make. They
also extract the fibres from the
<i>Hig</i> or pointed aloe plants,
by beating them between
stones, the fibre then being
twisted into ropes. The
Somáli women lead the camels
on the longest marches, and
exhibit wonderful powers of
endurance, marching sometimes
the four hundred miles
from the Webbe to Berbera in
about sixteen days. From constantly loading camels they
become nearly as strong in the arms as the men.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>mag</i>, <i>dia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or blood money for a man killed is one
hundred milch-camels. Among the Habr Yunis, Habr Gerhajis,
if one man of the tribe kills another the blood money
is one hundred she-camels and four horses, half this number
being considered enough for a woman. For the loss of an eye
or permanent disablement of a limb fifty camels have to be paid,
and for the loss of both eyes or disablement of both limbs the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
full blood money, as for murder, is demanded. If blood is
drawn from the head about thirty camels are demanded, and
even for a bruise the demand is for three or four camels. Such
minor cases, however, are, as a rule, specially referred to the
mullahs for decision. As a matter of fact, in most cases the
blood money actually paid is far below the nominal amount.
If a man captures his wife during a raid on another tribe, he
generally sends a present afterwards to her parents to secure
peace; should, however, a married woman be carried off, or one
to whose parents cows have already been paid by another man,
the offence is a grave one, and the tribe of the woman must
fight. One of the most unpardonable offences is the striking of
any one with a shoe or whip, or the open hand, and theoretically
this act can only be wiped out by blood.</p>

<p>There are always innumerable blood feuds going on in
Somáliland, but as a rule the tribal fights are not very serious,
a dozen men killed in every thousand engaged being a fair
proportion. The men slain in these combats are buried on the
spot, and then begins a long series of negotiations for the
settlement of the amount of blood money, which generally lasts
months, or even years, before any result is arrived at. Often
at a council all the old men on both sides will get up in a fury
and leave hurriedly for their kraals with angry shouting, showing
that diplomacy has failed.</p>

<p>This sitting in council discussing tribal politics appears
to be the principal occupation of Somális, and at Berbera,
in the native town, they may generally be seen sitting in circles
holding protracted discussions. They appeal to our courts to
decide the greatest and most trivial cases, delighting in arbitration;
and tribes from very great distances inland, even from
Ogádén or the Marehán country, come to the Berbera Court
with cases, a great number of which have to do with raids of
some sort, which have been committed either upon grazing
flocks and herds or upon caravans.</p>

<p>Although a good deal of intermittent fighting is prevalent
all over the interior, the Somális have no quarrel whatever with
the English. They hold respect for the English as being their
natural protectors and arbitrators. The chronic fighting which
goes on throughout the country is only looked upon by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
elders as healthy blood-letting, giving the young men something
to do. It is only considered serious when it occurs
on the main caravan routes, thereby damaging trade. In
Guban quarrels and raids have practically ceased within the
last five years, a fact which is entirely due to British influence.</p>

<p>The Somális love display, and do honour to their own
sultans<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by the performance of a ceremony called the <i>dibáltig</i>.
When this function is to be gone through a body of horsemen
is collected, and line having been formed, the tribal minstrel
or <i>gérára</i> sings, while sitting in the saddle, long extempore
songs in praise of the sultan and the tribe, the most atrocious
flattery being the leading feature of the song. At every great
hit scored by the minstrel the song rises to a shriek, and all
the horsemen turn and gallop away, returning and reining up
in a dense mass, crying “<i>Mót!</i>” (Hail to thee). The men are
generally dressed in the red <i>khaili</i> tobes, and the saddlery is
covered with red tassels. Among the Esa tribe the <i>dibáltig</i> is
represented by a dance on foot, with shield and spear. In
this dance the warriors go through the performance of pretending
to kill a man, crowding in a semicircle round him, and
stabbing him again and again, all the while yelling “<i>Kek-kek-kek!
Kek-kek-kek!</i>” as they gasp for breath. I have the
authority of Captain Abud, the assistant Resident at Berbera,
for stating that the <i>dibáltig</i> is never performed except on
the election of a sultan or in honour of an English traveller,
whom the people recognise as a representative of the paramount
authority in the country. It may be performed in honour of
Europeans other than English who visit the country, but only
when they do so under the ægis of the British Government.
Among Somális themselves it is the open recognition of the
authority of a sultan, and notifies the acceptance of his
rule by the sub-tribes or <i>jilibs</i> performing it. It may therefore
be looked upon as a species of coronation ceremony. The
word <i>mót</i> is the royal salute. The assistant Resident at
Berbera had a case brought before him in which a part of the
Eidegalla tribe had thrown off allegiance to Sultán Deria, and
when Captain Abud’s intervention was successful, one of the
terms proposed by the delinquents themselves was that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
would <i>dibáltig</i> before him as a recognition of their return
to his control.</p>

<p>The influence of the Mussulman teaching is apparent in
many of the predominating customs throughout the country.
The Somális are as a rule clean and decent in their dress, and
of course such a thing as a drunken Somáli in Somáliland is
practically unknown. I have seen a man dangerously ill with
snake-bite, and believed to be dying, refuse brandy when
offered to him as a medicine, saying that he would rather die
than take it.</p>

<p>In speaking of Somális I do not, of course, attempt to
describe the Aden hack-carriage driver or boatman. These
products of civilisation are not found in the interior of Somáliland;
they are, to my mind, the only true Somáli savages. The
Aden Somáli as a boy diving for silver coins in the harbour is
a delightful little fellow, but when he grows up he becomes
odious. As a cabman or boatman he sees too much of the
weaknesses of Europeans, and as a result of the familiarity
he loses his respect for them. To cite an instance of the
familiarity which breeds contempt, Aden Somális have been
known to call visitors from passing ships “damned fool passengers”!
The real jungle Somáli from the African side of the
Gulf never quite gets used to Aden life. After having made
his money there, he returns to his own country to invest his
savings in cows, camels, and sheep, and a wife or two to tend
them. He lives the old pastoral life, and soon shakes off
every trace of his sojourn among the white men. Give him a
fine house in Aden, and he will build a round <i>gurgi</i> of mats
and skins inside it.</p>

<p>In the far interior I have more than once met a horseman,
looking quite like a jungle Somáli, tricked out in all the finery
of a mounted warrior, yet whose salutation has been “Good
morning, sir,” in excellent English, and I have found that he
has been to Marseilles and London, having done his spell as a
fireman on a steamer; and he has come back at last to his
country, disgusted with civilisation, and worse in many ways
than when he started on his travels. With such a man the
jungle Somáli will often refuse to eat, saying he is no longer a
clean Mussulman, that he is a <i>Frinji</i>, and must eat alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever faults a Somáli may have, lack of intelligence,
and what, for want of an English word, may be called <i>savoir
faire</i>, are not among them. His bringing up, in a country where
every man has his spears ready to hand to answer an insult on
the moment, tends to make him keep his temper and maintain
a diplomatic calm. Once that calm is broken through, however,
he becomes a veritable madman. From laughter to rage
is the transition of a second. Luckily he keeps his infrequent
tantrums for black men. The rich white man is a privileged
person, being allowed the eccentricity which may be excused in
the great. If a white man, in pyjamas and slippers, unfortunately
loses his temper, and kicks a lazy Somáli all round his
zeríba for breach of contract, the latter sulks for a time, but
soon gives way before the ridiculous; yet he will permit no
Somáli to insult him.</p>

<p>There is no written Somáli language, so only a few mullahs
who are learned in Arabic can read the Koran. The bulk of the
people who cannot read are more prejudiced than the mullahs,
wishing to be on the safe side, and having all sorts of complicated
rules which mullahs know to be unnecessary. For a long time
we could not get our men to eat game which had had the throat
cut low down, although the customary <i>bismillah</i> had been said
as the knife was drawn. On going to Hargeisa I appealed
to Sheikh Mattar and his mullahs, who explained to them that
they might eat the flesh of game bled in this way, and after
the sheikh’s decision we never had any trouble on this point.
It is an important one, for a gash in the skin from ear to
ear is very unsightly in a valuable trophy when set up in
England.</p>

<p>The fastidiousness of Somális varies according to circumstances.
They say all game is dry, and will not generally eat
birds or fish, and they will despise all other food if there is a
fat sheep to be procured. Not eating birds, their ignorance
about them is extraordinary, and I believe very few varieties
have distinctive names.</p>

<p>The life of a Somáli includes many interesting observances,
which unfold themselves day by day in the course of a journey.
Some are very regular in their prayers and prostrations at the
orthodox hours, praying for all they are worth, in season or out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of it; others seldom or never pray. When on the Gálla frontier,
however, I noticed that every one of my followers, in view of
approaching death, became very devout, and mustered in great
force in line for the daily church parade at sunset, no one being
absent; and all day on the frontier the Somáli looks for a prowling
enemy under every bush, fingering his <i>tusba</i> or chaplet to
keep away evil.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>When the new moon appears he plucks a tussock of grass
and holds it in flattering compliment between the slender
crescent and his eyes, to keep them from being dazzled by the
light. If he sees a tortoise he stands upon it, first casting off
his sandals, believing, I think, that the soles of his feet will
thereby be hardened; but whatever the motive may be, the act
is very commonly practised.</p>

<p>One of the chief faults of the Somáli is carelessness. When
a caravan moves off in the early morning there is generally a
forgotten camel or straying sheep to be hunted for, which has
perhaps wandered miles away into the bush. The men who have
not to lead camels linger round the camp-fires warming their
spears, thereby storing up heat for ten minutes longer to comfort
their hands on their cold morning march. There is a great deal
of shouting to the stragglers to bring along things which have
been left behind. On our Abyssinian frontier reconnaissance our
men temporarily lost, at different times, our goats, three Arab
riding camels, the horse, a flock of sheep, and one or two baggage
camels, besides two boxes of Martini-Henry ammunition.
The man who loses or forgets a thing generally remembers the
omission after travelling about fifteen miles, and he then cheerfully
trots back to get it, returning perhaps at noon next day.
He is philosophical as to results, for if he loses your property, is
it not his fate? and no man can fight with fate or with the will
of Allah! He has lost your property, and there is an end of it.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>Although I have made many jungle trips in India and
elsewhere, yet in no country have I had such obedient and
cheerful followers and such pleasant native companions, despite
their faults, as in Somáliland. In my earlier and later trips
I have often been from one to four months in the interior with
no other companion than the Somális; and I cannot say there
has been a dull moment.</p>

<p>Captain H. M. Abud, who has for some years lived in, and
had the immediate administration of Berbera and Bulhár, and
the greater part of the Somáli coast protectorate, and who is
doubtless the best authority on the intricate intertribal relations
of the Somális, has very kindly furnished me with a few notes
on what he knows about their early history. He says: “The
real origin of the Somális is wrapped in mystery. They themselves
say that they are descended from ‘noble Arabs,’ who,
having had occasion to fly from their own country, landed on the
Somáli coast and intermarried with the aboriginal inhabitants,
many of whose descendants still exist, though they now mingle
with the Somális.</p>

<p>“The Somális, although none of them, except a few mullahs,
can write, know their genealogical descent by heart, and,
although the custom is beginning to die out, nearly every
youngster is made to learn the names of his forefathers in their
order. Out of at least a thousand elders examined by me while
working at the genealogy of the tribes, none could trace their descent
further than twenty or twenty-two generations; and if this
number is correct the dawn of the Somáli nation would be placed
about twelve or thirteen hundred years ago, nearly coinciding
with the rise of Mahomed, on whose account the Arabs were
obliged to fly from Mecca. This coincidence in time is so much
in favour of the Somáli claim; but, on the other hand, it is
difficult to believe that ‘noble Arabs’ would knowingly give
their children the barbarous names some of them have. In
any case we must seek away from the true African races for
the origin of the Somáli, for he bears no trace of the negroid
type. It is supposed by some, from a resemblance, fancied or
real, in the languages, that the Somális may be allied to the
races of Hindustan. So far, however, the subject has not been
thoroughly worked out, and for all practical purposes the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
descent from ‘noble Arabs’ may be assumed as a convenient
starting-point.</p>

<p>“The two great tribal groups of the Somáli nation are named
Ishák and Dárud from their supposed progenitors, Sheikh Ishák
bin Ahmed and Sheikh Jaberti bin Ismail, whose son Dárud
is said to have been. The Habr Awal, Habr Gerhajis, and
Habr Toljaala tribes, with whom we have most dealings in
Berbera, belong to the Ishák group; and the Ogádén, Bertiri,
Abbasgúl, Géri, Dolbahanta, Warsingali, Midjerten, Usbeyan,
and Marehán belong to the Dárud group. The descent of
the Esa and Gadabursi tribes is unknown, but it is more
than probable that they are offshoots of a great tribe called
Rer Afi.</p>

<p>“The tribal collective prefixes Rer, Habr, Ba, and Ba Habr
are often met with. The Somális are a nomad race, and the
tribes wander about, each in an orbit of its own, in search of
pasture for its flocks and herds. A wealthy Somáli surrounds
his huts, cattle, sheep, and camels by a zeríba of brushwood,
and one of these, with the contents, is called a <i>rer</i>, being the
kraal or temporary village. It will easily be understood, therefore,
that all the descendants of a man called, say, Ibrahim,
may be called the ‘Rer’ Ibrahim after him.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>“Every Somáli, being a Shafai Mussulman, can have four
wives at a time, and it is each man’s object to have as many
children as possible, to increase his own power and that of his
tribe. Plurality of wives being allowed, the children of one
wife must be distinguished from those of another. This is
done by the prefix Ba. For an example of this, we have
the case of the Rer Dahir Farah sub-tribe of the Habr Toljaala.
The children by an Ibran woman were called the Ba Ibran;
those by a Habr Awal woman were called the Ba Awal, and
those by a woman named Gailoh, the Ba Gailoh.</p>

<p>“There are comparatively few names used among the Somális,
the changes being rung on different combinations of Mahomed,
Ali, Hassan, Esa, Samanter, Ismail, Gadíd, and others, many
of which are names used in every Mussulman country. Owing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to this scarcity of names, and to the vast number of people
consequently named alike, the use of nicknames is very prevalent.
A Somáli will, as often as not, when asked his name,
tell you his nickname, and I have known many a man at a
loss when asked his real name. For instance, the descendants
of Daud Gerhajis are called the Eidegalla, meaning ‘he who
rolls in the mud,’ while those of Said Harti are known by his
nickname, and are called the Dolbahanta tribe.</p>

<p>“Somáli children are, as often as not, named after the
circumstances of their birth, unless they receive ordinary
Mussulman names: for instance, Wa-berri means that the
man bearing this name was born in the morning, from <i>berri</i>,
morning. Similarly, the bearers of the name Gédi, ‘a
march,’ were born while the <i>rer</i> or kraal was shifting to another
pasture. Gadíd denotes a man born at noon, and Róbleh,
from <i>rób</i>, rain, a man born in wet weather. Descriptive
nicknames are suggested by some personal peculiarities, as
Afhakam, Afweina, ‘big mouth,’ Daga-yéra, ‘small ears.’
Even Europeans do not escape, and such names as Gadweina,
‘big beard,’ Gudani, ‘small stomach,’ Madah weina, ‘big
head,’ have been bestowed on English officers without any
disrespect being intended; and the bearers of these nicknames
are known by them, especially when Somális are speaking
among themselves.</p>

<p>“The usual divisions among Somális are the tribe, the sub-tribe,
the clan, and the <i>jilib</i> or family. Thus the chief of the
Eidegalla, Sultán Deria, would describe himself as Habr Gerhajis
(tribe), Eidegalla (sub-tribe), Rer Mattan (clan), Rer Guléd
(family). If further asked he would describe himself as one of
the Ba Ambaro, or sons of Ambaro. In the event of a man
having a large number of sons, he is entitled to call himself a
separate family; for instance, Shirmáki Adan, a man still living
and still procreating, has already twenty-three sons and twenty-nine
daughters, and these are now called the Rer Shirmáki
Adan. A weak clan is likely to be looted and absorbed by a
stronger, and thus the weaker clans join together for protection.
When whole families so unite the members combine under the
name ‘Gáshánbúr,’ or ‘brothers of the shield.’ Somális have
no surnames in the English sense, and when a distinction is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
be made, the name of the man’s father is added to his own.
Thus the son of Shiré Shirmáki is Deria Shiré, and he again
might have a son called Hussein Deria.”</p>

<p>Without myself having gone so deeply as Captain Abud
into evidence on historical questions, I have been led, in a long
intercourse with the natives at the camp-fire and on the march,
to draw my own conclusions on certain points.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> From ruins,
cairns, and graves which have been pointed out to me to be of
Gálla origin, I have been led to believe that before the Arab
immigrations what is now called Somáliland, even to the
northern coast, was owned by the Gállas. The immigrant
Arabs and their followers with “friendlies” on the spot,
becoming strong, began to seize the coast, driving the
original Gállas inland towards the parts of their country
which lie round Harar and beyond the Webbe. On the
frontier between the Somális and Gállas there are periodical
raids still in active progress from one side or the other. These
raids were occurring at Karanleh on the Webbe when I went
there in 1893, and put me to much inconvenience; and in
1889, when I visited a mission station called Golbánti on the
Tana River, not far from Lamu on the east coast, I found a
Somáli encroachment taking place.</p>

<p>The Gállas at this place a few years before my visit numbered
between one and two thousand souls, rich in cattle, but latterly
they had been annually raided by the Masai from the south
and the Somális from the north, till the village of Golbánti had
dwindled down to about one hundred and fifty inhabitants, and
it had been only kept going by the exertions of, and protection
afforded by the representative of the United Methodist Mission
who was stationed there. Three years before my visit the former
missionary and his wife, an English lady, had been murdered
there by the Masai, and less than two years later the German
station of Ngai, a few miles up-stream, had been burnt by a party
of over a thousand Somális, who came to within a short distance
of Golbánti, but were unprepared to attack the fine stockade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and house which had been built by the missionaries, the upper
verandah having been thoughtfully lined with a few rifles.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The
German missionaries from Ngai had taken refuge in the Golbánti
house, and saw the flare of their own mission burning a few
miles away. The Gállas at Golbánti said they feared the
Somális even more than the Masai, as the former being good
swimmers, the Tana River was no obstacle to them.</p>

<p>The southern Somáli tribes are very bold, and are said to
raid cattle from the Gállas and take them to the mixed Gálla and
Arab town of Lámu, on the east coast, to sell them again. As
they have horsemen, they are said to be able to cope with the
Masai, whom they sometimes meet when both are raiding the
Gállas near the Tana. I saw a few of the southern Somális
walking about Lámu. They appear to be rougher, more savage,
and finer men than the northern Somális.</p>

<p>The Gállas of Golbánti were well-featured men, very quiet in
manners, brown in colour, with thin lips, and slightly built.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
The Somális are very like them, but rather bigger and better
built, and the only difference that I could observe was that there
appeared to be some Arab blood in the Somális. The little I
saw of the nomad Gállas at Imé and Karanleh on the Webbe
tended to strengthen me in the belief that the Somális are
Gállas with a very slight strain of Arab in their blood. The
Somális themselves, of course, deny this, and claim their descent
to be from the higher race. The Gállas and Somális, though
such bitter enemies, are much alike, and both are utterly different
from the negritic and mongrel Swahili races to the south.</p>

<p>On the Tana I found a river population called the Wapokómo,
negroes of fine physique, lorded over and held in
bondage by the warlike Gállas; and on the Webbe Shabéleh a
river race called the Adone, who were also negroes, were working
in the fields and punting rafts on the river for their
masters, the Somális.</p>

<p>My theory is that the Gállas seem to be wedged in between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the continually advancing Somális from the north and the
Masai from the south, the apex of the wedge being somewhere
near the Tana mouth, and the base at the sources of the Juba.
The effect of this pressure is perhaps driving the Tana Gállas
up the river, to the country where they are more numerous and
can hold their own.</p>

<p>Monseigneur Taurin Cahaigne of Harar, who probably knows
as much as any man living about the Gállas, hinted, so far as I
can remember, that the origin of the Gálla nation was probably
near the mouth of the Tana, and that they spread northward and
westward from there.</p>

<p>The tribe occupying the coast round Zeila is the Esa, and
those about Bulhár and Berbera are the Habr Awal, and farther
east Habr Toljaala. The nearest inland tribe to Zeila is the
Gadabursi, and those on the Berbera side are the Habr Gerhajis
and Dolbahanta. The six above named are the tribes with which
the British authorities have most directly to deal. Of these the
most capable in war is probably the Esa. The Gadabursi and
Habr Awal fear them, and it is only because the former tribes
are mounted and the latter have no horses that the balance of
power is maintained. The Esa are chaffed by the Ishák tribes
for being uncouth and barbarous. The men go about dressed
in a simple short cloth round the loins, while eastern Somális
generally wrap themselves in a full tobe. The Esa women do
not necessarily cover up the breast, while among the Ishák
tribes all but the oldest and most destitute are well dressed
from head to foot. In no tribe that I have seen do the Somáli
women cover the face.</p>

<p>The Gadabursi tribe is rich in ponies of a poor stamp. The
Jibril Abokr sub-tribe of the Habr Awal is, I think, the best
mounted among the tribes named, and the Dolbahanta also
have enormous numbers of good ponies, and are wild and
addicted to raiding on a very large scale.</p>

<p>It is certain that Somáliland has at different times been
occupied by highly-organised races, whose habits of life have
been quite different from those of the present nomadic tribes.
Widely distributed over the country are traces of permanent
settlements, many of them probably of great antiquity. Some
appear so ancient that they might belong to any time, of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
all record has been lost. Many of these ruins are traced to
Mussulman occupations by the Arabs from Yemen, some
hundreds of years back, but other older remains are assigned
by tradition to a people who were “before the Gállas.” There
are no writings, and many of the remains are scarcely recognisable
as being of human origin. Sometimes blocks of dressed
stone are found lying in a rectangular pattern on the ground,
overgrown and half buried by grass and jungle; a series of
parallel revetment walls on a hill overlooking a pass is
occasionally to be met with, and frequently one may observe
the scanty evidences of an ancient tank to catch rain-water.
It is possible to travel for weeks in Somáliland without
coming on these remains; they are met with by chance, and it
seldom occurs to the natives to think of pointing them out to
travellers.</p>

<p>Near the mullah village of Guldu Hamed, at Upper Sheikh,
are the remains of a very large ruined town, and close by there
is a graveyard containing some five thousand graves. I believe
these remains are not very ancient, but are traced to early
Mussulman settlements from Yemen. West of Hargeisa is an
old fort of considerable size, crowning the detached hill called
Yoghol. In the Gadabursi country there is the ancient ruined
town of Aubóba, and at the head of the Gáwa Pass, on a hill
to the west, and about four hundred feet above it, are some
massive ancient ruins, which must have once been a fort, commanding
the pass. They are called Samawé, from the
name of a sheikh whose tomb crowns the ruins. The hill-top
is surrounded by parallel retaining walls built of dressed stone,
rising in steps from the bottom. In some places the walls were
six or eight feet high, and there were remains of extensive ancient
buildings filling the enclosure. Surmounting the whole in
the centre was the ruin of a building of cut stone, which
appeared to be the sheikh’s tomb.</p>

<p>The position of the Samawé ruins would favour a supposition
that some power holding Harar, and having its northern boundary
along the hills which wall in the southern side of the
Harrawa valley, had built the fort to command the Gáwa Pass,
which is one of the great routes from the Gadabursi country up
on to the Marar Prairie. On the other hand, the fort may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
have been built by a power holding the coast, to close the pass
on the Harar side.</p>

<p>Within half a mile of the Samawé tomb, on the sloping
ground to the south, we found a curious stone enclosure, half
buried in jungle. It was in the form of a rectangle measuring
fifty-seven yards by fifty-eight yards, marked by long rows of
dressed stones, each about nine inches by a foot, lying loosely
on the ground. Some of these were blocks of limestone, and
some apparently basalt.</p>

<p>Near Hug, in the mountainous Jibril Abokr country, my
brother found many signs of old “Gálla” habitations and
graves, and some well-made pathways down the hillsides. His
followers told him that the hills having in the olden time been
used as places of refuge by the Gállas, these roads were made
to enable the cattle to be quickly driven up in case of alarm—the
custom being for a part of the clan to camp on the top of
a hill, in order to hold it, while the rest looked after the flocks
and herds grazing below. He was told that the Gállas on the
Abyssinian border, and the Abyssinians themselves, still do this.</p>

<p>All over the territory of the Ishák tribes, and in the
Dolbahanta country, we found many old Gálla graves and
cairns. At Kirrit there is a well in which a very ancient cross
has been carved in the face of the rock. Crowning nearly
every prominent hill in the countries named is a cairn or pile
of stones, each stone being, roughly speaking, about the size of
a man’s head. They are made up of many hundreds of such
stones, and are generally about twelve or fifteen feet high and
eight yards in diameter. Each one is circular, having in the
centre a depression, suggesting that there may have been a
tomb beneath, which has fallen in. I never cared to dig one
up, not wishing to offend the susceptibilities of the natives.
Some of them are of immense size, and are called Taalla Gálla
or Gálla cairns.</p>

<p>There is a curious legend accounting for the origin of these
cairns, which was told me by one of the Esa Musa tribe, while
I was camped on the Golis Range, and by others of the Habr
Awal at different times.</p>

<p>The drift of his story was that when the Gállas were in the
country there once lived a great and powerful queen, called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Arroweilo. She was very wicked, and was the origin of all
evil in women at the present day. For some reason she
conceived a ferocious prejudice against all male children, and a
mother, to escape from her tyrannies, fled into a far country
with her baby boy. As years went on this son grew, and when
he had become a man he returned into Arroweilo’s country
armed with a sword. He attacked Arroweilo in a lonely pass,
and hacking her to pieces, tied her remains on a camel, and
sent it off with a parting cut. The camel trotted in mad
career all over the country, and wherever a piece of Arroweilo
fell, the pious native, as he passed, said a prayer and threw a
stone “to keep her down.” The chief use of these cairns now
is to form cover for robbers when watching for caravans; and
my brother and I found they made very recognisable points
when seen through the telescope of a theodolite.</p>

<p>At Badwein (<i>i.e.</i> “Big Tank”) in the Dolbahanta country, one
hundred and fifty miles, as the crow flies, from Berbera, we
found a tank forty feet deep and a hundred and twenty yards
in diameter, evidently excavated by human labour. Near it
was a temple or large house with walls still standing at a height
of ten feet, and the space enclosed was so large that a party of
horsemen could ride into it.</p>

<p>The Dolbahanta told us that before the Gállas a race of
men occupied the country who could read and write. Unfortunately
none of their literary work was visible, as we
examined many remains for inscriptions, but found none. One
man, for a small fee, took us four miles out of our way to read
an inscription, but the result was not promising, for we only
found on a tombstone some scratches, perhaps twenty years old,
evidently made by an idle sheep boy. All these discoveries of
ancient remains go to prove that the elevated parts of Somáliland
(not semi-desert Guban) have once been capable of
permanent settlement under a more secure form of society than
at present exists.</p>

<p>The deserted village of Dagahbúr in Ogádén is an example
which shows how settlement and cultivation have been successfully
begun, and abandoned because of the insecurity resulting
from intertribal feuds. At Dagahbúr there were formerly
many square miles of <i>jowári</i> cultivation, which have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
abandoned within the last few years, and now there is only left
an immense area of stubble and the ruins of the village.
Dagahbúr used to be a thriving settlement of one thousand five
hundred inhabitants, with trade caravans plying regularly across
the Haud to Hargeisa and Berbera; and now not a hut is left.</p>

<p>The fact is, that although the natural conditions are suitable
to the settlement of large tracts of country, and though many
of the people are willing enough to engage in cultivation, yet
the tribes and sub-tribes are so incessantly at feud, that the
religious mullahs or widads, who enjoy a certain immunity from
raids, alone dare settle down and cultivate; and now that many
of the old wells and tanks have fallen into disuse and ruin, the
water-supply could only be restored by a great expenditure of
capital, for which there would perhaps be no adequate return
for some generations.</p>

<p>There appear to be two distinct varieties of camel in Somáliland,—the
Gel Ad, or white variety, sold mostly on the Berbera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
side, and the Ayyun or dark Dankali one, which is common on
the Zeila side. Both have the single hump. The Esa themselves
admit the superiority of the Berbera camel, and offer a
higher price for it. There are certain camels fattened for the
butcher, which are never used for carrying loads. They can be
recognised by their hairiness and the great development of the
hump, but they are not, I believe, a distinct variety. Somális
know their animals individually by name. A fine large camel may
often be christened “Maródi” (the elephant); another, noted for
its pace, is sometimes flatteringly called “Faras” (the horse).</p>

<p>The Somáli camels, as contrasted with those of India, are
willing and gentle; and although whilst being laden they will
generally complain, and make feints at biting, yet I have
seldom known them injure any one. In moving about the
camp at night one has often to pass among them as they kneel
in rows, sometimes stepping over them, or stooping under their
outstretched necks, but I have never had experience of a vicious
camel in Somáliland. Even when undergoing firing operations
they rarely bite, although the head is left free. This accommodating
disposition I attribute greatly to the manner in
which they are treated by the natives, who, though rather
cruel to their ponies, will never ill-use a camel. Many Somális
are utterly ignorant of loading, this work being done largely by
the women. When a camel is intractable it is generally through
ignorant handling. The Somális talk and sing to their animals
when loading and unloading, and whistle while they are drinking,
some of these songs used upon such occasions being of very
ancient origin. During loading the camels are made to kneel,
and the head-rope is passed round the knees and made fast there.</p>

<p>When marching with loads they need to be watered every
fifth day, though upon emergency we have often worked them for
ten days without distress. While on the march they are tied
head to tail, as in Northern India. In rocky places, where the
caravan animals are liable to stumbles and sudden stops, the
tail is sometimes torn off.</p>

<p>The usual load is not less than about two hundred and
seventy-five pounds, exclusive of mats, but it varies according to
the nature of the load. Dates are bad to carry, being compact and
heavy in proportion to their size, and the date load is generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
two <i>gosra</i>, or two hundred and fifty pounds. European baggage
comes under the same category. The marching hours are
from about 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> to 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and from 1 to 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> The
camels are allowed to graze during the midday heat, and
for half an hour before sunset. It takes three-quarters of an
hour to load up, from the time of rounding in the grazing
camels to the start off, and unloading takes about fifteen
minutes. In stating these particulars I am giving our own
average with complicated boxes, tents, loads of trophies, and so
forth, a Somáli caravan taking probably less time. The usual
rate of marching is from two and a quarter to two and three-quarter
miles an hour, not counting short halts to adjust loads.
The fastest rate, for a short distance, which I have tested has
been three and a quarter miles an hour. The loaded Somáli
camel will not trot as a rule, though sometimes the Midgáns
train them to do so, leading them by a string.</p>

<p>Camels are always delicate, and I have considered myself
lucky when I have not lost more than five per cent of my
camels on a three months’ expedition. In Ogádén the <i>Balaad</i>,
or small gadfly, is a terrible scourge to them, and, to a lesser
extent, so is the large gadfly, or <i>Dúg</i>; they are also infested
with ticks, which swell to the size of a date-stone, and are seen
clinging round the eyelids. In drinking the camels often take
in small leeches, which fix themselves to the root of the tongue,
growing to a great size and filling the mouth with blood.</p>

<p>Should a camel show stiffness, he is at once fired, either by
raising small blisters with a red-hot ramrod or spear, or by striping
with hoops of red-hot iron. Open sores have glowing stones
strapped over them, followed by an application of moist camel-dung;
and when off his feed, he is dosed with melted sheep’s tail.
Thorns are excised from the foot with the <i>biláwa</i> or dagger, and
the spike—often two inches long—having been extracted, camel-dung
is applied, and as a general rule the cut soon heals.</p>

<p>A great cause of sickness is a sore back, brought on by the
chafing of a load. The worst place is in front of the hump.
A camel when let out to browse is likely to bite such a sore
until it festers and becomes full of maggots. There is a fly
which is on the look-out for these sores, and instead of laying
eggs deposits lively maggots, which crawl about briskly directly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
they leave the body of the fly. A red-beaked bird, very
common in Ogádén,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> then attacks the sore, plunging its sharp
beak again and again into the hole, picking out the maggots
and decayed mass, and even the good flesh, until there is a
cavity into which a man’s clenched fist may be thrust. When
in this condition it should always have a strip of calico, steeped
in carbolic solution, tied over the wound when sent out to graze,
to protect it from the birds, a dozen of which can be often seen
clinging flat to its shoulders, giving out at intervals their long-drawn,
discordant, shrill note.</p>

<p>The Somáli camel does not require grain, but thrives
entirely on whatever it can pick up by the way. Except at
certain seasons in Guban, the coast country, there is always an
abundance of food for them everywhere, in the unlimited expanse
of grass and acacia forest, as they feed and thrive on
many grasses that ponies will not touch. When grazing, or
browsing on the leaves of the mimosa jungles, they roam about
in enormous droves, attended by a few men and women. In
Ogádén and the Dolbahanta country I have seen driven past a
succession of herds, each containing over a thousand camels, as
they were taken to pasture in the mornings or back to the karias
at night. They often have to graze at a distance of six miles or so
from home, for, as the food near the karias is eaten up, they are
driven farther out daily, and after a month or two the mat huts
themselves are packed up and the tribe marches on, perhaps
ten miles, to a fresh pasturage. Horsemen are constantly
scouring the surrounding country to watch the next tribe, or to
bring early news of a pasture having received heavy rain.</p>

<p>Camels can be much more quickly rounded up and driven
to the home karia than cattle or flocks, so they are trusted
much farther afield, and the number of camels sometimes seen
is astonishing, the whole horizon being covered with them.
When camped at Gagáb by the Milmil river-bed we daily saw
between ten thousand and thirty thousand driven to water past
our tents, belonging chiefly to the Rer Ali tribe. In Ogádén
even an outcaste Midgán will sometimes own three or four
hundred, and the only limit to their numbers is the capability
of their owners to water and protect them. When a tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
becomes rich every man’s eye is covetously turned to this
accumulation of camels, and it is not long before attempts are
made to raid them in a mass. We were told of instances in
the Dolbahanta country where ten thousand had been looted at
one swoop. When unladen they can be driven at great speed,
and as the raiders are nearly always on horseback, the attack is
very sudden.</p>

<p>When grazing, in dry weather, they are watered every six
days or so, but when men are lazy, or animals very numerous,
much longer periods are allowed to elapse. When rain has
fallen, and the grass is green, camels, sheep, and goats are
sometimes not watered for three months. We often found tens
of thousands of camels and sheep grazing at least forty miles
from water. The men and horses attendant on them live
almost entirely on camel’s milk, a little water being carried over
these great distances for the women and children.</p>

<p>Mobs of camels are generally led by an old one of immense
size, a large wooden bell (<i>kor</i>) being hung round his neck to
indicate the position of the mob after dusk. When returning
from a good pasture, they show the exuberance of their spirits
by cantering and kicking their heels in the air. A man running
at best pace can with difficulty overtake one which is bent on
avoiding him, and for a greater distance than two hundred yards
the man is nowhere. They may often be seen scampering
about the sands at Berbera, the men following them for hours
trying to catch them.</p>

<p>According to the Somális, camels have a young one every
second year, generally in the <i>Gu</i> or monsoon. They begin to
foal when three years old; the foal—black, tawny-yellow, or
white as a well-washed sheep—soon gets on its legs, and in a
few days can scamper about. They are called <i>Gódir</i>, <i>Gel-Ass</i>,
or <i>Gel-Ad</i>, according as they are born black, reddish yellow, or
white, and they retain these shades through life. Yearlings,
older camels, and she-camels with their young are kept in
distinct mobs. The Somális object to the firing of a gun near,
or otherwise startling the she-camels when about to foal, as
they gallop away in panic, injuring stock. A she-camel,
besides nourishing her foal, will daily give milk for two men
who have no other food, and in the event of more being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
required, the young one is killed, and the skin removed, and
whenever the mother is milked its skin is rubbed against her
nostrils. She becomes quite tractable, and will follow the
man who carries the skin. If the foal is allowed to live,
as soon as it can browse the udders of the mother are
tied with bits of string, and the milk reserved for human
beings.</p>

<p>Somáli ponies average about thirteen hands and a half, and
are bred by every tribe except the Esa and Géri. Of the
tribes I have met on different expeditions, those having the
most ponies are the Dolbahanta, the Rer Ali, the Rer Amáden,
the Habr Gerhajis, and the Jibril Abokr sub-tribe of the Habr
Awal. In the Nogal country we saw enormous numbers, one
man sometimes owning one hundred and fifty. The Somáli
pony carries a light weight splendidly; his feet are harder than
even those of an Arab horse, and, indeed, unless well shod the
latter would make poor work on the rocky ground over which
the Somáli animal, which is never shod, will gallop at full
speed. He is handy among bushes, and will go for three days,
or even longer, without water, eats nothing but grass, and
requires no care. I have never seen a Somáli pony covered
up or groomed; it is exposed to all weathers, and is usually
infested with ticks. The <i>Kud-kudaha</i> is a tick about half an
inch in diameter, with a tortoise-shell back, its bite being
venomous and drawing blood. Ponies are bred solely for intertribal
fighting, the mares being considered the best.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Burton, in his <cite>First Footsteps in East Africa</cite>,
gives an admirable description of the Somáli pony and his
rider, not very flattering to either. But he could not have
seen the best stamp of pony among the Gadabursi, and we
have noticed that the tribes farther to the east were not so
cruel as the Gadabursi, a man often dismounting and walking
to save his animal.</p>

<p>The few ponies which are kept in waterless tracts, as a
guard for the grazing camels, receive each a daily allowance of
the milk of two camels mixed with a quart of water, the latter
being brought from great distances. They are never used as
pack animals, being too valuable in the eyes of the Somáli to
be degraded by doing donkey’s work. Mules are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
used on the Zeila-Harar road, but are found nowhere else in
Somáliland, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>We tried the best Somáli ponies ridden by their owners
against an ordinary 14.1 “Gulf Arab” which I imported from
Bombay, and which was ridden by my brother. The Somáli
invariably jumped off with a good start, keeping it for about
one hundred and fifty yards, and then dropping hopelessly
behind when once the advantage of the start was lost.</p>

<p>Donkeys are not much used for transport except on the
Zeila-Harar roads, where the nature of the country is stony.
They are largely employed in taking salt and rice from Zeila
to Harar, a bag of rice weighing one hundred and seventy
pounds, or half a camel load, being carried by each. Only
women ride donkeys, the Somáli man considering it beneath
his dignity to do so.</p>

<p>When surveying in 1886, with a small escort of Bombay
Infantry sepoys, I provided each man with a donkey, either to
ride or to carry his valise and water-bottle on, according to
inclination. There were twelve men so mounted, and the
experiment proved a great success. The donkeys were driven
herded together by two little boys. The escort was composed
partly of these men and partly of Hindustáni policemen
mounted on ponies, carrying carbines in saddle-buckets. In
my later journeys, however, finding that the natives of
Hindustán, being used to plenty of water, were at a great
disadvantage when crossing waterless tracts, I formed the
escort purely of well-drilled Somális, and this arrangement
proved less expensive and better adapted to the requirements
of the country.</p>

<p>Cattle are kept chiefly by the tribes inhabiting hilly country
where water is plentiful, and by the mullahs in their settlements.
Cow’s milk is generally tainted by the smoked vessels in which
it is kept, and to obtain good milk it is necessary to see the
cow milked. Ghee, or clarified butter (<i>subug</i>), is prepared from
the cow’s milk which is left after the people have drunk their
fill, and this ghee is sent down for sale to Berbera, where the
coast people, who live chiefly on rice, consume a great quantity.
Somális need fat or butter, and when not eating mutton or
camel’s flesh, or drinking large quantities of milk, they insist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
upon a plentiful allowance of ghee to mix with their rice.
The cattle from the interior are largely exported to Aden for
the supply of the garrison, and vast quantities of hides are
annually exported to America. It is possible that the Aden
supply has been affected of late years by the great drain caused
by the Abyssinian foraging expeditions into Ogádén.</p>

<p>Sheep and goats constitute the ordinary Somáli meat food.
Camel meat is preferred, but it is considered a luxury, and
cattle are seldom killed. The common sheep are of the
black-headed variety (<i>dumba</i>), with fat tails, and they are seen
whitening the hillsides wherever tribes are encamped. In the
rains they get very fat, their tails becoming flabby masses.
At this season the Bur Dab raider hurries back to his family,
to luxuriate on the delicious meat. Sheep are given as presents
to caravans, and, like fruit in India, “they represent in the
bountiful East the visiting cards of the meagre West.” In
many places a chief is not supposed to be officially aware of a
stranger’s presence till he has received his gift of a sheep or
two, or a piece of cloth. Sheep and goats can ordinarily go a
week without water, but when grass is green they require none.
We saw thousands of sheep grazing in the Haud pastures,
forty miles away from water, and we were told they would
remain there for three months.</p>

<p>Somáli sheep have no wool to speak of, and are never
sheared. A few goats are herded with every flock of sheep, and
the goats, being by far the more intelligent animals, take the lead
when the flock is moving. The shepherd walks in front, calling
to the goats, and they are followed by the sheep. Sheep are
imported in large numbers to Aden. In 1891 there were
sixty-eight thousand exported chiefly to feed the garrison.
Amongst the tribes quantities of sheep are killed daily, and
devoured at the evening meal in the karias, with singing and
dancing. Mutton only ranks second to camel meat as the
favourite food of a Somáli.</p>

<p>The annual movements of the trading caravans and the
nomad tribes of Somáliland depend, of course, on the seasons.
Roughly the duration of the seasons is as follows:—</p>

<p>(1) <i>Jilál</i>—January to April—the driest season; great
heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) <i>Gu</i>—May, June—the heavier rains (little felt on the
coast).</p>

<p>(3) <i>Haga</i>—July, August, September—the hot weather.
The <i>karíf</i> wind, or south-west monsoon, blows furiously. It
is hot in Guban, with sand-storms, but cold on the Haud and
other parts of the high interior.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Dair</i>—October, November, December—the lighter
rains. Heavy on the coast.</p>

<p>(5) At the end of <i>Jilál</i> is a short season of greatest heat just
before <i>Gu</i>, called <i>Kalíl</i>.</p>

<p>Of these seasons the <i>Haga</i> is the most unpleasant on the
coast, the <i>karíf</i>, a strong south-west gale, sweeping along with
great fury, blowing the dust and stones in the face of any
caravan so unfortunate as to have to march against it, and
making it impossible to keep a tent up. The wind generally
commences at midnight and blows till 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> on the next
day; the remainder of the twenty-four hours, from 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> till
midnight, being a time of great heat, which is even more unpleasant
than the wind, unless tempered by a slight north-east
breeze, coming as a reaction after the fourteen hours’ gale. My
usual plan was to make the longest marches in the mornings,
in spite of the wind, and on halting, to camp under the shade
of a tree till the wind should have stopped sufficiently for us
to pitch tents. Then at night a bivouac was made by piling
all the baggage and camel-mats into a steep wall, all of us
sleeping under the lee of it in the open, by which means one
could get a comfortable sleep till morning; but I never kept
up a tent during the wind-storm.</p>

<p>At this season coast communication by dhow is very uncertain;
dhows cannot beat against the <i>karíf</i>, but while sailing
before it they make about eleven knots an hour. Dhows for
Aden cannot leave the Berbera harbour during the <i>Haga</i>
season until evening, when the lull occurs, and then they sail
out to near the lighthouse, three miles west of the town, waiting
till midnight to cross towards Aden; on getting thirty-five
miles out to sea they are usually clear of the <i>karíf</i>. This wind
seems to cease above the level of Guban, and above Gólis the
heat of July is mitigated by cool south-west breezes which are
not very violent. As one descends again to the Webbe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Shabéleh valley in the far interior, one comes into the <i>karíf</i>
again; it is much worse at Bulhár, Berbera, and Karam than
it is on the Zeila side.</p>

<p>In the <i>Kalíl</i> season, the intense heat just before the rains, I
have registered 118° Fahrenheit under the shade of a double
“Cabul” tent at midday, in my camp at Malgui in the
maritime mountains. As we marched to the camp where this
heat was registered, several of the men were bleeding from the
nose, and on my asking them the reason, they said cheerfully,
“Oh! Allah makes our noses bleed to cool our heads.” The
Somális do not wear anything on their heads, and the close-shaven
skulls of the older men are entirely exposed to the hot
sun.</p>

<p>Caravans coming down from a distance of ten or twelve days’
march—that is, from Milmil or from this side of Gerlogubi—generally
make two trips to the coast each year. For the first
trip they come down from the interior late in the <i>Haga</i>, or
about September, leaving Berbera again for the interior in the
<i>Dair</i>, about December. They then come on a second trip in
<i>Jilál</i>, bringing down animals, hides, ivory, feathers, gum, and
ghee; and return in <i>Kalíl</i>, taking up chiefly rice and cloth.</p>

<p>From distant parts of Ogádén, or the Webbe, caravans
make one trip a year, coming down at the end of <i>Haga</i> and
returning in <i>Kalíl</i> or the beginning of <i>Gu</i>. Many smaller
caravans, coming from the nearer parts of the Haud and Ogo,
and engaged in petty barter, make more than two journeys to
and from Berbera. Those coming from Fáf in Ogádén make
the journey in, say, fifteen days’ fast marching without halts.
The <i>gédi</i>, or march, is usually from four to five hours, ten to
twelve miles being covered. The start is made at 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>,
marching goes on till 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, the midday halt giving the
camels time to feed till 1 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, when another march is made
till about 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Eastern tribes make longer marches than the Gadabursi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and Esa. The longest are made over waterless or uninhabited
country, while in the inhabited tracts the caravan dawdles at
every encampment. Our own men used to advise us to make
one long march instead of two short ones, but we found it did
not benefit the camels, the only saving being in trouble to the
men, as the camp had to be formed once instead of twice.</p>

<p>In the hot weather on the Berbera maritime plain, the best
time to march is at night, especially if there is a moon; the
caravans swing along at a great pace in the cool of the night,
especially if the paths are good and there is not too much
jungle. Caravans leaving Berbera in the evening march
throughout the night, reaching Laferug, thirty miles from
Berbera, before halting.</p>

<p>At Berbera the camels are handed over, by arriving
caravans, to the Esa Musa sub-tribe of the Habr Awal, or other
nomadic people similarly situated, who tend them till such
time as they shall be required for the return journey to the
interior.</p>

<p>In <i>Haga</i> the Esa Musa and similar tribes are to be found
at or near the base of Gólis Range, and in <i>Dair</i> they climb up
this step into the Ogo country, which is vacated by the Habr
Gerhajis tribe, who in their turn have retired far into the Haud,
where the pastures are good at this season. In <i>Jilál</i>, the dry
season, the Haud, having neither green grass nor surface pools,
is uninhabitable, and the Habr Gerhajis being obliged to come
north into their Ogo pastures and about Gólis Range, the Esa
Musa are apparently pushed down into Guban and the maritime
plain, which is their own country. In the <i>Gu</i>, or heavy rains,
the best season for grass, the Esa Musa have only their own
sheep and cattle to look after. They are then found in Ogo,
the Habr Gerhajis being far out in the Haud, taking advantage
of the green pasture.</p>

<p>All the nomads belonging to the coast tribes go into the
Haud when there is green pasture and surface water, each tribe
moving generally north and south, and keeping to its own strip
of the plateau. Their best pastures are in the Haud, but they
all have to leave in <i>Jilál</i>, and are then sure to be found north
of the Haud edge. Sometimes the Habr Awal cross the Haud
nearly to its southern edge, and at others the Ogádén come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
northwards till about half-way across. In this way what may
be called the “orbits” of tribes overlap. In the <i>Gu</i>, or rains,
when the Habr Gerhajis are far away in the Haud, and competition
at the coast is at its lowest ebb, the Esa Musa export
their cattle and sheep to Aden. They have agents at Berbera,
and as opportunities offer, batches of, say, ten oxen or two
hundred sheep are brought down for export, marching by easy
stages. Coming from Bur’o, eighty miles from the coast, cattle
or sheep reach Berbera in four to six days, while caravans
generally cover the distance in three days.</p>

<p>Overlooking the Berbera-Bulhár coast track, at a spot about
twenty-four miles west of Berbera, is a low spur of bare sandstone
hills, called Dabada Jiáleh, ending at a single <i>jia</i> thorn-tree,
and it is known as a spot which has till a few years ago
been used by Esa Musa marauders as a watching-place when
on the look-out for Ayyal Ahmed or Ayyal Yunis caravans
passing along the track. There are similar spots all over the
country, known as watching-places, sometimes a sandy hillock,
sometimes a “boss” of rock (<i>dagah</i>, the South African <i>kopje</i>);
and many have descriptive names, such as “Dagaha Todoballa”
(rock of the seven robbers), showing the use to which they
have been put.</p>

<p>Annually when wandering in search of rain, tribes which
are at feud are liable to meet where their orbits overlap, and
so often is there a fight, and a few graves on the scene of action
are left to mark the event. The country is further rendered
unsafe by raiding and plundering parties which surprise caravans,
and gangs of highway robbers, who do not disdain to attack
small parties, or single men and women in charge of a camel
or two.</p>

<p>In the <i>Gu</i>, when the coast tribes are in Ogo and Haud,
and there are pools of surface water everywhere and green
grass for the ponies, and the tribes, moreover, have all their
numbers present, a great deal of petty warfare and raiding goes
on. Large mounted bands of young men go out from the
tribes and travel great distances in search of caravans, or of
grazing flocks. When out on raid the cavalier ties a grass
water-bottle to his saddle-bow, together with a quantity of sun-dried
meat, and thus provided he will often cross seventy miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of thorn forest to surprise his neighbour’s flocks and herds.
The attack, made at dawn or in the afternoon, is arranged to
take place suddenly, and it is timed when the male owners
are scattered far and wide, sleeping in zeríbas or under the
shade of trees, wrapped up in their tobes, and the flocks are
only attended by boys and girls. The looted animals are
hastily driven off, urged by gentle spear pricks, and the raiders
return to their tribe to the musical strains of lowing cattle,
bleating sheep, and screaming camels. If the enterprising
horsemen are pursued in force the captured flocks are relinquished,
but the camels, travelling faster, are clung to as long
as possible, at the risk of a human life or two. A looted horse
is a great prize, and the happy gainer will boast long and
loudly of his deed.</p>

<p>In my several expeditions we were constantly crossing the
tracks of these looting parties, which muster from thirty to
four hundred mounted men. We actually fell in with a
Dolbahanta troop, which was returning from an unsuccessful
raid on the Habr Toljaala herds, having covered a journey of
one hundred and forty miles.</p>

<p>Sometimes when resting at night the men sleep in line on
the ground, the bridle of each pony being passed round the
man’s wrist and the pony standing over him. In fighting
order the troops are in single or double line, extended at an
interval equal to the breadth of one pony.</p>

<p>The tribes near the northern coast most addicted to raiding
appear to be the Jibril Abokr sub-tribe of the Habr Awal,
the Mahamud Gerád Dolbahanta, and the Eidegalla, Habr
Gerhajis. Late caravans, going into the interior in the beginning
of <i>Gu</i> by the Mandeira route, are liable to be raided by
the Jibril Abokr, parties of whom come from Arabsíyo, by
Argán, to the low Assa Range, an extensive tract of broken
country, and there wait for several days together on the chance
of catching caravans on their way through the Murgo and
Jeráto Passes. The time is chosen when the Esa Musa and
Habr Gerhajis are absent in Ogo and Haud searching for
pasture, and have left unoccupied the stretch of country below
the passes. The marauders, hiding in broken ground and deep
ravines, will subsist for a long time on stolen camels, picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
here and there, until a sufficiently large caravan yields a rich
harvest of camels and property, with which the robbers then
decamp to their own country.</p>

<p>Caravans going from Berbera to Hargeisa, Milmil, and the
south-west, fearful of danger, will go directly south by Sheikh,
and thence round by Toyo Plain, to Hargeisa. The Sheikh
Pass is also used by caravans fearing to go into the interior by
the Gaha and other eastern passes, which are annually threatened
by the Mahamud Gerád; but both the Sheikh and Jeráto
Passes have been greatly improved, both in point of safety and
practicability, by the British authorities within the last three or
four years.</p>

<p>When water and grass are to be had for the horses, the
Mahamud Gerád, Dolbahanta, and the coast section of the
Habr Gerhajis organise strong mounted bands, which sweep
through the Duss and Gaha Passes, and raid sometimes as far
as Biyogóra and the Berbera maritime plain, carrying off everything
they can steal, and retiring at once. They often make
raids in the Waredad Plain above the Huguf Pass in the Habr
Toljaala country, and few are the caravans which have the
hardihood to come through this country by the Haliélo route.
In fact, the Mahamud Gerád raids from the east, across the
caravan routes to the Ogádén and Marehán countries, do immense
harm to the Berbera trade.</p>

<p>In the Dolbahanta country we found many natives with
hides piled in their karias ready to be taken to Berbera, but
fearing to risk them on the road. One caravan took advantage
of the protection afforded by our escort to pass through the
disturbed Bur Dab district. That caravans have persisted in
crossing the country at all in face of the dangers to which they
have always been exposed, speaks well for the value of Berbera
as a port, and for the trading enterprise of the Somális. The
British system of furnishing armed “biladiers”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for the protection
and at the expense of caravans has given great encouragement
to trade.</p>

<p>Men of caravans on meeting in the jungle will halt to exchange
the news, and with one’s own caravan it is difficult to
make a guide pass his own karias. I have often been led five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
six miles out of my way because the guide’s karia lay in that
direction. His ambition is to bring the caravan to his home,
to show off his own importance to his relations, and to be able
to play the host with a liberal distribution of his master’s
presents. On the march our men have constantly shared their
allowance of food with strangers who have been going our way,
and we have sometimes been astonished, when loading up at dawn,
to see half a dozen natives warming their spears over the dying
embers of our watch-fires, who have turned up in the night from
no one knows where. In many cases these are women, and
being industrious, they save the men a good deal of work.</p>

<p>Somehow or other there is nearly always a woman or two
in camp, generally young, pretty, and respectable, with the hair
enclosed in the regulation dark blue bag, denoting that she is
married. When I ask where she has sprung from I always
hear, “Oh, one of Mahomed’s cousins,” or “Jáma’s sister.”
Generally “Jáma’s sister” was going to a karia on ahead, to
see about a stolen sheep. These relatives are always quiet,
cheerful, and thrifty, eating little and doing the work of two
men, besides inducing half a dozen youngsters to work harder
at camel-loading to show off their muscles. They appear
whenever we come to a karia, and disappear mysteriously at
another farther on, just as passengers get into a train at one
station and leave it at another. Often my men have told me
that the new-comers were people who had been waiting to make
a journey, but, fearing to do so till we came by, they had
joined us for the sake of our protection, working for us in
return.</p>

<p>Sometimes I have been standing over a fire in the cold
wind an hour before dawn, waiting for the cook to bring me
my cup of coffee, without which I never march, when a youth,
whom I have never seen before, has put down his shield and
spears on the grass, and going to my bedding, has brought my
ulster, saying, “Oh, <i>Sircal!</i><a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> here is your coat,” in the most
natural way, as if I had paid him for a month.</p>

<p>It is wonderful how quickly these strangers worm themselves
into one’s service. An unlicked cub of a karia dandy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
comes up with shield and spear and joins your caravan. In a
few days he has shown some special qualification, for tracking
or camel-loading, for helping the cook, or carrying the theodolite.
An accident deprives you of one of your men, and he receives
the sick man’s rifle and cartridge belt, and is numbered among
your escort. In a fortnight he has come to the front as one of
your best men, and on the next expedition he may be head
camelman, and perhaps on a third or fourth he may be interpreter
and caravan leader. When he first joined you a year
before he knew no language but Somáli and a little Arabic,
but while in your service he has picked up a fair amount
of Hindustáni. A few years later you meet him again as a
merchant, who has in the interim accompanied half a dozen
European sportsmen on shooting trips, and has now invested
his savings in merchandise, trading with tribes which he would
never have dared to visit except in the service of his white
masters. Many a time have I wished that I could transform
the complacent, shaven-headed, sleek-looking scoundrel back
into the original unsophisticated cub with the well-oiled mop
of hair who came into my camp two or three years before!</p>

<p>In January 1887, after having previously made six exploring
expeditions to the interior of Somáliland, I started upon my
first sporting trip after big game, my caravan consisting of eight
Somális with four camels. Marching thirty-five miles inland
from Berbera, we pitched our first shooting camp at Hulkabóba,
and the following day we ascended the Golis Range by the
Sheikh Pass, halting in Mirso, a ledge two miles wide, situated
two thousand feet above our last camp, and about half-way up
the mountain, where there is excellent pasturage. We here
formed our bivouac beside a spring of clear water, and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
sandy torrent beds which formed its approaches we found many
lion and koodoo tracks. Before leaving the coast I had sent
two Somális on horseback to the cedar forests which clothe the
flat top of Gólis to search for fresh elephant tracks. On this
evening they arrived to report having found no recent sign, so I
decided to go to Sheikh, twelve miles to the east, and thence to
try Wagar Mountain.</p>

<p>At about 3 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> we loaded up and started on our march.
The path led over rocky country along the side of Gólis,
through thick belts of jungle and across sandy torrent beds,
which in many places showed the fresh tracks of lion and
antelope, but not of elephants. It was very hot and the sharp
stones were fearfully trying to the camels, nevertheless we had
to push on in order to reach water while daylight lasted; we
failed, and night overtaking us, we were compelled to camp on
the hillside without it.</p>

<p>Next morning our march took us through a maze of ravines,
about the worst ground I have ever traversed with baggage
animals; then descending abruptly to Lower Sheikh, we found
a plot of green turf bordering a stream and surrounded on all
sides by steep mountains. The Sheikh Pass takes its name from
the tomb of a sheikh built in the form of a sugar-loaf plastered
with a white substance, which forms a very conspicuous landmark
at the top of the pass. While forming camp at Lower Sheikh
we were passed by a large caravan, which was fording the stream
on its way with hides, gum, feathers, and other commodities,
from the Ogádén country to Berbera, and soon afterwards my
trackers arrived with the welcome news that they had struck the
path of a herd of elephants,—a bull and four cows,—two marches
to the south of the sheikh’s grave. They had followed and
marked down the elephants to a jungle where they were likely
to stay, at the back of Wagar, and they further reported the
bull to be a fine tusker. I engaged three horsemen from among
the Habr Gerhajis, whose pastures were at Lower Sheikh, to
take up the tracks, and on sighting the herd to send one of their
number back to guide us to the spot; meanwhile I waited at
Lower Sheikh, looking about for koodoo. Soon afterwards
my people led in a shepherd boy, who had seen a bull and cow
koodoo retire up one of the steep gorges of the Sheikh valley to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
take their noon rest under a large tree. A hot walk along the
banks of the Sheikh river, at this time a mere brook, brought
us to the karia where the boy had first seen the koodoos. On
the left bank of the river a gorge ran up into the mountains, and
opposite to its mouth stood the karia, a circle of half a dozen
poor-looking huts.</p>

<p>I waited here while my Midgán hunter and the boy went
to the foot of the hills; soon they reported that the position of
the game was unchanged. The koodoos were still under the
large tree at the head of the gorge some four or five hundred
feet above us. The only way to get at them was to go up
another gorge parallel to the one which contained the tree, and
to leeward of it. On nearing the tree, after a tedious climb, I
happened to crack a stick, and immediately there followed a
crash and stampede below us. All noise soon ceased, but I
caught sight of something moving down the gorge in front.
Stooping cautiously, I looked through a thorn-bush, placing
the muzzle of my express within the network of twigs; after
a second or two I could make out one large brown spiral horn
and a bit of striped skin lying somewhere over the shoulder, so
taking a quick aim a little below this, I touched the trigger and
a beautiful bull koodoo rolled twenty feet down into the torrent
bed in the centre of the gorge, and was stopped by a large mass
of rock. The cow galloped madly away, loosening a shower of
stones with her hoofs, and soon there came from below the
sound of two shots from a Snider as she raced past my camelman,
Núr Osman, who had been posted at the mouth of the
gorge; but crossing the Sheikh stream, she took to the hills on
the opposite side of the valley and escaped. Leaving orders at
the karia for a camel to follow us with the koodoo meat we
started home.</p>

<p>The return walk in the evening down the valley was as
wild and picturesque as one could wish. Núr Osman and the
Midgán led the way, carrying the head and skin of my first
koodoo, at which I could not help looking admiringly from time
to time, for it was a great prize. Our path led close to the
stream, over dark slippery rocks, with here and there a plot of
rich turf running down to the water’s edge. At our backs the
sun was setting behind the crest of Golis, and in front rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
gigantic precipices, the hills having been quarried out by the
river into a deep canon. As it grew dusk my reflections were
disturbed by a wart-hog boar, which had come down to drink in
the cool stream after a hot day, but I had no reason for firing
at him, his tusks being poor.</p>

<p>The next day one of the three horsemen came back to tell
me that he had marked down the herd of elephants, and that it
was being watched by his companions. He carried in his hand
pieces of half-chewed aloes with the saliva still damp upon them,
which the elephants had torn up a few hours ago. Leaving
most of the baggage behind in the camp at Lower Sheikh,
and posting Núr Osman and another of the men in charge,
I mounted the Sheikh Pass the next morning at sunrise,
accompanied by two camels and five men. At the top of the
pass I shot a spotted hyæna, to the delight of the mullahs
living at the village of Guldu Hamed close by, as it had stolen
several of their sheep.</p>

<p>Half an hour before sunset two horsemen came racing over
the plain from the Wagar direction, and poising their spears
circled round us at full speed. They pulled up shouting “<i>Mót!</i>”
(Hail!) and reported the latest tidings about the herd. I learned
the melancholy news that it had got away in the night. My
men, however, tried to comfort me by saying, “<i>Insh’ Allah
Bukera</i>” (Please God, to-morrow). We camped at an empty
zeríba in a strip of bush near Soksodi, where there was firewood
and water, intending to search for the elephants next day. We
lit a roaring fire and threw ourselves down on the sand to sleep.
At dawn, while my men were preparing coffee, I took a stroll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
round camp, and saw by several broad footprints in the sand
that a large lion had been prowling round our bivouac all night
Later on my men pointed out old tracks of elephants, broken
branches, and aloe clumps, indicating the course of a herd which
must have passed two or three days before. I sent all the men
into the covert to look for fresh tracks, but at noon they
returned unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus7">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>At two in the afternoon some shepherds came to water a
flock of sheep on their way to the Berbera market, and they
said that they had passed a herd of elephants only an hour ago
in a valley to the south. On my asking for a guide they
refused, hoping to get me to pay heavily for their information,
so I shouldered my double four-bore rifle and started with the
two Midgán trackers on the back trail of the sheep, hoping to find
the elephants without a guide. The path led past two small
sandstone hills, and we then entered a sloping valley, down the
centre of which ran a sand-river bordered by dense jungle.
Heavy masses of <i>armo</i> creeper draped the branches of the trees,
and as we advanced fragments of creeper, which had evidently
been torn down by the elephants, lay across our path.</p>

<p>We soon came to the fresh tracks of a herd which must
have passed early in the day, and the Midgáns began to follow
the footprints with great interest. The signs became every
moment more distinct; at one spot the elephants had taken a
long halt, rolling in the sand; and after half an hour’s tracking
we found evidences that we were quite close to them. Sitting
down with one of the Midgáns, I sent the other up a small
hill to look around; he soon returned, whispering “<i>Maródi,
Maródi!</i>” (elephants). Having joined us, he shaded his eyes
to have another look, and then stretching out his hand, he
pointed to two reddish brown spots among the lower branches
of a clump of high trees on the farther side of a glade. As we
looked six large elephants and four calves walked solemnly by
twos or in single file out into the open. Even in this moment
of excitement, for I had never seen a wild elephant before, I
noticed the huge ears of the African species, the high fore-quarters
and quick, active pace, and a beautiful sight it was!
Swinging their heads from side to side, they crossed the glade
and entered a clump of trees. Here they stopped and began
feeding about, the swaying and snapping of the branches, and
the peculiar low rumbling which they give out when feeding,
indicating where they stood, though we could not see them.</p>

<p>The Midgáns, who were new to the work of attacking
elephants on foot, did not quite like the prospect of going with
me into the middle of the herd, so taking the four-bore, and
telling them to watch from a low hill, I began creeping into the
jungle alone. In thick forests the chief difficulty of elephant
hunting consists in picking out the one with the best tusks, and
then getting close up to it without being winded or seen by the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>I threw up some sand to try the direction of the wind, and
then advanced very silently for a hundred yards into the thickest
jungle. I heard the rustle of some creepers in front of me, and
then peeping through the underwood I saw three elephants
fanning themselves with their ears under a very large camel-thorn-tree,
whose branches rose to a flat fan shape high above
their heads. It was from this thorn-tree that one of them had
just been pulling down the creepers. From my left came the
rumbling sound made by a fourth elephant, but I could see
nothing there. I had on entering the jungle unconsciously
walked into the very centre of the herd, and there was now
no time to be lost in making my choice, because one of them
might at any moment get down wind of me and sound the
alarm.</p>

<p>The elephants I had seen were standing about forty yards
away, one being a little apart from the other two, close to
a tree, and I could see that a pair of tusks protruded from its
lips. I advanced to within fifteen yards of the foremost one,
which looked quietly at me for some moments, its trunk feeling
the wind, as if wondering whether I might or might not be the
stump of a tree. Raising my rifle I fired at the centre of the
temple, half-way between the eye and the ear. The smoke
obscured my view, but I the next instant could hear the jungle
stirring all round me as the elephants made off. Then every
living thing seemed to have left the place. As the smoke
cleared away it disclosed, fifteen yards off, the body of the
elephant sitting motionless with its knees tucked under its chest,
a single hole in the temple showing where the bullet had entered.
This turned out to be the largest cow in the herd, and I afterwards
found, by a thorough examination of the tracks in the
neighbourhood, that there was not a single bull.</p>

<p>Satisfied with my success so far as it went, I did not follow
the herd, and in answer to my whistle the Midgáns came up,
astonished to see that a single bullet had done the business.
The camels were brought up, and we formed our bivouac by
the dead elephant, and at dusk the tusks lay beside the camp-fire.
Next day we marched to Sheikh, and found the camp
safe, and in the evening began our march back to Berbera.</p>

<p>Two months later I set out again, beginning by a dhow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
voyage of one hundred and fifty miles across the Gulf of Aden.
I hired four camels and two camelmen at five rupees a day,
or about £10 for a whole month.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I also engaged a caravan
leader, three servants, two Somáli trackers, and a Midgán, not
a large party to go into an unknown country with. To guard
against the possible attack by robbers at a time when the English
even at the coast were very little known, I lent my three
servants a Snider carbine each. The remainder of the men had
their spears and shields, and the Midgán, Adan, carried his bow
and arrows. My “butler,” Núr Osman, had been a camelman
in the Nile expedition for the relief of Gordon, and had become
a very fair shot.</p>

<p>By the light of a full moon we started across the Berbera
Maritime Plain, going south-west; and at 1 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> we
reached a small tree called “Nasíya” (the resting-place),
sixteen miles from the coast. Early in the night we passed
several karias of trading caravans which were halted round
Berbera for the trading season, each circle of mat huts pouring
out a crowd of Midgán dogs to give us a surly salute. At the
last karia I fired at a spotted hyæna, but missed him. At
Nasíya we threw ourselves down on the sand, and unloading
the camels took a short sleep to refresh ourselves for the work
yet before us, and at 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> we pushed on again towards the
first water, Deregódleh, which is twenty-two miles from Berbera.
As we advanced the bare-looking Maritime Plain began to
break up into stony watercourses and thorny bush. We
passed, to our right, a detached flat-topped hill of trap formation
called Sýene, part of the first low Maritime Range.</p>

<p>Near Sýene I saw two buck Sœmmering’s gazelles, looking
large and white by the light of the rising sun, which was at
my back. The wind was blowing from the front, and I made
a careful stalk, but on raising my head from the last watercourse
the <i>aoul</i> had removed themselves three hundred yards distant,
and were stopping to gaze. They had seen my camels coming
along. Then with whisking tails they trotted away, and I
never saw them again. Very nearly related to this gazelle is
the Cape springbuck. Sœmmering’s gazelle carries a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
graceful, lyre-shaped black horns, about fourteen inches in length
and well ringed. When still scarcely clear of Sýene, catching
a glimpse of dark red in a watercourse two hundred yards to
my left, I walked towards it, put up a Waller’s gazelle, and
bagged him with my Martini-Henry rifle.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="smcapuc">A.M</span>. we reached Deregódleh, a watercourse which
has cut its way deep into the limestone rock of the interior
plain and hollowed it out into caves, in which sheep, when
waiting at the wells, take shelter from the sun. There is some
very low cover on each bank, in which hares and the little
<i>Sakáro</i> antelopes are to be found.</p>

<p>We left Deregódleh and marched to Mandeira, a delightful
headquarters. It is a valley about three miles wide, under
Gán Libah mountain, a bluff of the great Gólis Range. The
mountains overlooking this valley rise to about six thousand feet
above sea-level. The high country beyond them is called Ogo,
the interior and Maritime Plains below them are called Guban.
The Ogo climate is much cooler than that of Guban, and the
grass and jungle more luxuriant. At Mandeira, all along the
foot of Gólis, is more or less dense forest of the large <i>gudá</i>
thorn-tree, with a thick undergrowth of aloes and thorny bushes.
Here are found leopards, lesser koodoo, Walleri, and wart-hog.
The pugs of an occasional lion may be seen, and in the gorges
of the mountain is to be found the large koodoo, with his splendid
spiral horns, and the <i>Alakud</i> or klipspringer. In the stony
interior plains between Gólis and the Maritime Range are found
oryx, wild ass, the ubiquitous Walleri, the lowland gazelles, and a
few shy ostriches. Spotted hyænas are common, striped hyænas
rare.</p>

<p>We camped near the water at Mandeira at midday, and
found the valley occupied by a section of the Habr Gerhajis
tribe, who were friendly. While here I shot a buck lesser koodoo
and missed a splendid bull koodoo, which crossed a ledge of
rock two hundred feet above us. The buck lesser koodoo is, I
think, the most beautiful wild animal in Somáliland; his coat
is fairly long, of a French gray colour in old males, and nicely
marked with white bands across the body. The horns are
spiral, and about twenty-five inches long, and he has a bushy
tail tipped with white. When disturbed he goes away in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
bounds, flying the bushes and clumps of aloes, and presenting a
most difficult shot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus8">
<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">“Flying the Bushes.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>Hearing that there were elephants near Little Harar (Hargeisa),
we went on to Gulánleh, about twenty miles short of that
place and ninety south-west of Berbera. At Gulánleh the country
became open and undulating, the Gólis Range having ceased,
and Guban rising gradually to the level of Ogo. Hargeisa is
situated in the district between Ogo and Guban, which is called
Ogo-Gudan.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The country immediately north of Hargeisa is
called the Damel Plain, a vast plateau of rolling ground
covered with gravel or red earth, and low thorny scrub,
and traversed by tributaries of the Issutugan river-bed. The
Issutugan is a sand-river at places from one to five hundred
yards wide, which, rising near Hargeisa, cuts through the
Maritime Range and sends its freshets over the Maritime Plain
to reach the sea near Bulhár or Géri. The tributaries are
generally dry and sandy, with patches of dense reeds, and are
bordered by belts of high tree jungle about a mile wide.
These reeds, generally ten feet high, were at that time infested
by lions, which did not appear in the daytime, but left plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
of tracks in the sand, showing where they had prowled up and
down the river-beds at night. In May, June, and December
elephants used to come down these rivers to feed on the creepers
and aloes of the forest belts along their banks, often leaving
the shelter of the trees to stand in the patches of reeds.</p>

<p>I had determined to make Gulánleh my headquarters for
elephant-hunting, and to send my two Somáli trackers, who
were mounted, together with a Habr Gerhajis horseman who
had joined us at Mandeira, into all the large elephant jungles
within twenty miles. Meanwhile I remained at Gulánleh,
going out shooting every day. Here I was lucky enough to
bag two very fine bull oryx and two cows, all four having long,
straight horns. A few buck Walleri and plateau gazelles
followed, and on the second day of my stay we put up nine
ostriches, there being two cocks and seven hens. I fired at
them with the Martini-Henry at three hundred yards as they
sailed away, but only knocked up the dust around them. Three
times we fell in with ostriches, but always found their vision too
good for us. They look like gigantic fowls as they go streaming
away over the plains. At Gulánleh we also saw a herd of
wild asses, which halted fifty yards away to gaze at us. We,
however, held our fire, not considering them fair game. They
were splendid animals, very well marked with stripes on the
legs.</p>

<p>On 13th May my patience was rewarded by the arrival of
the three horsemen, with the news that they had found a large
herd of elephants at Jalélo, about twelve miles away to the
west; so we packed a few blankets, axes, tinned provisions, and
other necessaries on a camel, and filling my pockets with dates,
I set out at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> for the Jalélo covert, accompanied by
two mounted trackers, the Midgán, and two other men, leaving
the Gulánleh camp in the charge of Núr Osman. The forest
at Jalélo consists chiefly of the heavy <i>gudá</i> timber bordering
the Hembeweina river, which lower down is called Issutugan.
There are extensive tracts of reeds in the river-bed, and these
are so dense it is hard work forcing a path through them,
and once inside, it is impossible to see anything except at a
distance of a few feet. After a hot march we struck the
Hembeweina river at Jalélo, and, sending the mounted trackers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and all the other men to hunt up the elephants, I sat under a
wild date-palm, and lunched off sardines, dates, and the contents
of my water-bottle.</p>

<p>The midday sun had been fearfully hot, and I was just
dozing off to sleep under the grateful shade of the date-palm,
when my head tracker, Hussein Debeli, came bounding up in a
wonderful state of excitement, brandishing his big stabbing
spear and dancing round me in circles. I knew at once that
his news was good, and, after a pause to take breath, he said
he had suddenly seen a very large bull elephant in the bed of
the river only half a mile below my palm-tree. Packing everything
quickly on the camel, and leaving orders for it to be
brought on slowly after us, I took Hussein Debeli as guide, and
shouldering my four-bore rifle, which weighed over twenty pounds,
I started off to look up the elephant. As we rounded a spur
he came into full view, walking quickly down the centre of the
river-bed below us, turning his head from side to side as he
swung along, his great ears sticking out at right angles like
studding-sails. He looked rather disturbed in his mind, and
as a breeze was blowing from us down the river towards him,
he had no doubt winded us, or one of the men who had been
sent to look for him.</p>

<p>Going as fast as we could, we ran along the high bank to
intercept him, and if possible to get below and to leeward of
him before beginning the attack, but as we got nearly abreast
he saw us and broke into a shambling trot. Seeing that he
was escaping us I opened fire with the four-bore, though the
range was at least seventy yards. At the shots he spun round
and turned up stream again at a great rate. Bathed in perspiration
from the hot sun, and desperately thirsty, I followed
as fast as I could, and at last, in the distance up the river,
appeared the two horsemen, with red tassels flying and spears
flashing in the sun, galloping down at full speed to head the
elephant. This had the effect of forcing him to plunge into
the broad bed of reeds, where he pulled up, comparatively
secure from attack. It so happened, however, that he had
chosen a spot where the steep river bank overlooked the reeds,
so that on going to the edge and peeping over, I could see his
head and the ridge of his back just rising above them. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
range was far, over sixty yards, but firing from where we were
was preferable to the impossible task of trying to approach him
noiselessly in the reeds, so, aiming for the temple, I opened fire
again. A right and left were answered by an unmistakable
crack as of a big bullet hitting bone, and by a “swish” as the
second shot, going over the mark, went innocently through the
tops of the reeds. The first shot, however, had told, boring a
clean hole through the flap of the ear and entering the skull
rather far back. The elephant gave a shrill trumpet, spread out
his ears, and spun round facing us, then he swung back into the
original position.</p>

<p>Another shot, fired at the place where I guessed his shoulder
to be, made him throw up his trunk and subside into the reeds,
but he was up again in an instant, looking very sick. This
would never do, so climbing down the steep scarp to the lower
level, and edging carefully round the margin of the reeds till
nearly opposite him, and then going in a little way so that I
could see his temple above the reeds some thirty yards away, I
took a very careful aim and fired. The elephant dropped at
once, and when my Somális, who were standing on the bank
beyond him, raised a hunting-song, I knew that he was dead.
We now went in, following the path he had made into the
reeds, and found him lying on his side, one tusk being four
feet long and fairly thick; the other had lost a foot from the
point, possibly broken off while uprooting a tree. He was a
fine fellow, and when we brought a tape later on, we found he
measured ten feet six inches perpendicular height at the shoulder.</p>

<p>The camel coming up, we got down axes and at once set
to work to cut out the ivory. I found the Somális very feeble
at this work, as it was sunset by the time they had removed
one tusk, and they seemed thoroughly exhausted. Then a
heavy rain-storm burst over us, and when it had stopped the
setting sun left us wet through, shivering under a thorn bush,
the river valley turned temporarily into an immense marsh,
and, worst of all, no moon. We had seen many fresh lion
tracks in the river-bed during our hunt, which fact did not tend
to improve the outlook, and my five men declared themselves
too exhausted to collect dry firewood, and lay like logs, looking
the picture of misery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>After ten minutes wasted in trying to coax them to help
me, during which I was only answered by grunts, I tried the
effect of storming at them, and seeing I was annoyed and fearing
for their precious salaries, they sulkily began to look about
for scraps of bark which might have escaped the general wetting.
They considered a fire unnecessary, saying that Allah would
keep the lions away, and that they were too wet and miserable
to care whether they were eaten up or not. Not being bad
fellows, however, they afterwards began to warm to their work,
and collected a goodly pile, and digging out a box of matches
from my bag, we soon had a cheerful blaze, and made a thorn
zeríba round our bivouac. The place now looked fairly comfortable,
with our clothes hanging upon the surrounding branches.</p>

<p>The Somális were before long snoring under some of my
blankets which I had to lend them, but I had no intention of
going supperless to bed, and sat up for two hours longer, cooking
a formidable dish of soup and a pot of cocoa, and on the
whole thoroughly enjoying myself, with the tusk of my first bull
elephant lying on the grass before me. The consequence was
that when we were roused up next morning by the sun shining
into our eyes, I felt quite fresh, while my companions did nothing
but grunt and shiver under the blankets. By noon we had cut
out the other tusk, and packing everything on the camel, we
set out to march three miles down the river to Hembeweina.</p>

<p>During our short march we saw lesser koodoo, oryx, and
Waller’s gazelles, but I was unsuccessful with these, and we
formed a second bivouac without having found the main herd of
elephants of which we had been in search. Next morning we
marched back to Gulánleh, intending to bring away our main
camp which had been left there, and to strike the river again
at Sobát, twelve miles above Jalélo. This plan we carried out,
forming an encampment at Sobát near the great rocks through
which the Issutugan trickles at this spot. Below our camp
the river-bed opened out into a broad, dry, sandy <i>wádi</i> without
reeds, and bordered by dense forest with aloe undergrowth.
The banks of this river from Sobát to Hembeweina were
carpeted with grass and there was a good supply of water;
moreover, the nearest Somáli karias were those of the Abdul
Ishák, Habr Gerhajis, at least twenty miles to the south-east.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
These are the conditions most favourable for the presence of
game.</p>

<p>On the morning after our arrival at Sobát I was rudely
awakened from my second sleep by Núr Osman poking me up
with the butt-end of a Snider, and informing me that elephants
had been heard trumpeting in the forest a short distance from
the tent, where they had been quartering about, afraid to come
to the water. It was still dark, but by the time I had lit a
candle and had a wash and breakfast, a long red line in the
east showed that the dawn was just beginning to break, and
we sallied out. We expected to come on the fresh tracks at
once, but we had searched the jungle round camp for at least
half a mile in every direction before one of the men, who had gone
farther afield, came running back saying he could show me the
herd. Pushing forward to the top of the next rise, we looked
about us, and in the thickest part of the forest we saw several
dark masses, which in the growing light we made out to be the
ears of elephants moving backwards and forwards as they stood
listening. Walking cautiously round them, we reached a small
hillock which overlooked the jungle to leeward of them, and
made a careful examination of the herd. While so doing we
discovered that it was a very large one, some of the cows
which we had at first overlooked being actually down wind
of us.</p>

<p>None appeared at first to notice us, but we must have concealed
ourselves carelessly whilst moving about looking for a
good tusker, and I think one or two of them later on became
aware of our presence. We had been watching them for
nearly half an hour, and a very pretty sight it was; the herd
numbered about sixty, and seemed to be made up entirely of
cows and young ones. Hitherto they had been browsing
comfortably and had seemed quite at home, as if the forest
belonged to them; now, however, they slowly but surely began
to prepare to move off the ground. Whether they had discovered
us, or were merely contemplating a change of quarters, was
not quite clear. In a short time a line began to be formed,
and they filed away in full view, travelling down wind, so that
we did not quite know, since we could see no bull, what was
the next thing to be done. They were moving at a steady
walk, and we amused ourselves counting them and examining
each individual, as I did not wish to shoot cows. I regretted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
much not having the means to photograph them as they solemnly
went by without fuss or noise, treading carefully, each small
calf hurrying along under its great mother’s hind legs. All
the cows of above medium size seemed to have tusks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;" id="illus9">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Elephant and Calf</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst I stood admiring the herd disappearing among the
trees like a dissolving view, I was reminded by the bloodthirsty
Hussein that we had come to destroy elephants, and not to
stare at them, so, the temptation being too much for me,
we took up their tracks through the heavy timber, with bad
aloe undergrowth, the crash, as an elephant now and then playfully
broke a tree ahead of us, being carried to our ears. Once
we followed too close, for a prolonged crash in our direction told
that an old cow was investigating the taint in the air. We, of
course, gave her plenty of room, as I wanted to have another
look for a bull before advancing to the attack, and when all
was quiet we resumed our tracking. The jungle was very fine,
so that while we were following the elephants we were generally
in the shade. We found the small <i>Sakáro</i> antelopes very
numerous, standing behind the aloes to gaze at us and then
darting off with their whistling alarm-note. Sometimes we
came on several tortoises, some of their shells measuring quite
two feet long and a foot wide. They seemed to live in small
families of four or five, and are very common in the aloe jungles.</p>

<p>At last, after a walk of little more than a mile, we again
sighted the elephants standing at the edge of the forest belt,
crowded together in three large groups, looking uncommonly
suspicious. Some high ground overlooked the jungle, and
circling round as far as possible under cover, we reached a
position very open and exposed, but otherwise good, being
down wind and sixty yards from the nearest group. We
were standing on a spur of the Damel Plain, covered with
loose gravel and sprinkled with a few small bushes. After a
rapid examination of the ground I opened fire at the biggest
elephant, and with indescribable commotion and clouds of dust
the three groups dissolved into a long string, rushing past us
headlong through the forest, only intent on escape.</p>

<p>The big cow which I had fired at was hidden in dust for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
moment, and then spinning round in a semicircle, she made off
after the others, her stern quite closing up the path. Following
on in her wake we caught up with some of the herd which
were lagging, and I fired at one which appeared to be a young
bull, bringing it down stone dead on its side, the bullet having
caught it behind the shoulders while going by at full speed.
Unfortunately, on inspection it proved to be a cow. Then,
continuing in the direction taken by the herd, we at length saw
the cow which had been first hit standing within forty yards of
a large tree, and stalking up to the tree, which was to leeward
of her, I fired at her temple. She went down and rolled over
on her side, the men, delighted at my success, running up to
jump on her back. Suddenly I shouted “Look out, she’s
getting up!” and I had scarcely time to cover her temple with
the foresight from where I stood, twenty yards away, before she
was on her legs again, with ears stuck out at right angles.
Another shot from the four-bore, and she fell dead.</p>

<p>The severe kick of the rifle generally sent me back a couple
of yards, and I must have been standing wrong, for as I
fired something gave way in my right leg, and I came down in
a sitting posture on to a clump of aloes, unable to rise at once,
and wondering whether the elephant was dead or not. I was
laid up in camp for three days, but on the fourth I could limp
about very creditably, and killed a fine wart-hog boar near
camp, besides firing at five striped hyænas, which were prowling
about at dusk among the rocks. When we had cut out the
tusks of the two cows we resolved to try fresh ground, and
getting astride of my mule I marched with my caravan to
Hembeweina, sixteen miles lower down the river. Here we
found in the sand the tracks of six lions of different ages,
which had been prowling about in the river-bed and in the
bordering reeds. Close to camp we found the half-eaten carcase
of a spotted hyæna which they had caught. They must
have been badly off for food to have eaten a hyæna; indeed,
from the absence of fresh tracks, we thought the rest of the
game must have been frightened from the vicinity by the
lions.</p>

<p>The day after our arrival at Hembeweina I was again
disturbed before dawn by Núr Osman, with the report that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
lot of elephants had been heard trumpeting near the water
during the night, and after a good breakfast we started in search
of them. After going up the river bank for about three miles,
we came to the large patch of reeds at Jalélo where I had
killed the first bull eight days before, and getting on to the
identical spot on the high bank from which I had fired at him,
we examined the expanse of reeds. The air was much tainted
by the dead elephant as we approached the edge of the bank,
too much so to make us care to go into the reeds to investigate
farther. Looking over the sea of yellow stems we suddenly
saw two cow elephants with one large calf in company, standing
under a date-palm well out in the reeds some two hundred and
fifty yards distant from the spot on which we were standing.
Wishing to get a bull, I decided not to attack them.</p>

<p>My Somális were advising me to advance upon these three
herd elephants, and we were sitting on the edge of the bank
intently gazing at them, when an indescribable feeling that
something was behind me made me look round, and there,
standing right over us, not twenty yards away, was an enormous
tusker quietly blinking his eyes at us and balancing his right
leg, undecided whether to go on along the top of the bank
behind us or to take a path straight down into the reeds. He
must have come up very quietly, for no one had heard a sound,
and my looking round seemed to have been accidental. Meanwhile,
as we were in the open on the edge of the scarp, in a bad
position to withstand a charge, especially as I was still lame,
we waited, crouched as we were, keeping as still as mice, and
watched the enormous brute making up his mind. We were
so much in the open that had I raised my rifle he would have
made us out at once. Perhaps I ought to have fired, but when
first seen his head was towards us and his trunk down, so that
he offered no certain shot. After swinging his foot once or
twice he took the path down into the reeds, treading softly, as
if afraid of cracking a stick, and looking curiously towards us
out of the corner of his eye, evidently unable to make out quite
what we were; when he was round the bank I stood up ready
to fire at him as he passed below.</p>

<p>On reaching the lower level he seemed to scent the dead
elephant, and began walking swiftly out into the reeds. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
was no time to be lost if I wanted those big white tusks, so
aiming quickly as he moved, I fired the heavy rifle at the root
of his ear, hitting him just a little too far back. A fiendish
change came over him, until now so calm and solemn. Out
went his great ears, and with his trunk curled up tightly in
front of his chest, giving a shrill trumpet he raised his head and
went crashing through the dry reeds, going up the river-bed
and presenting his side to us. Aiming for the shoulder, I again
fired, and struck him fairly in the ribs; this turned him across
the river straight away from our bank, and he dropped into the
wake of the three cows, which on hearing the shots had left the
palm-tree in alarm, and were already sailing away through the
reeds in fine style.</p>

<p>I was still very lame, and until the mule came up had to
content myself with watching the game disappear into the forest
on the farther side of the river. While they were crossing the
reeds the wounded bull gave an occasional squeal and charged
off at a tangent, pounding imaginary foes, and looking the
picture of annoyance. As the four elephants disappeared
among the trees they were joined by two strings of cows and
young ones which we had not seen before, followed by two
very large tuskers. I felt that I had made a mess of the
business, and regretted then that we had left the horses in camp,
as they would have been most useful in turning the elephants.
We had to wait some minutes for my mule to be brought up,
and it was 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> before we took up the tracks of the wounded
elephant.</p>

<p>The sun was beginning to get very powerful, making doubly
hard the work of advancing over the masses of fallen reeds
which obstructed the ground even in the path made by the
elephants. The tracking, however, was not difficult, as a wide
lane had been opened through the reeds everywhere bespattered
with blood. When we reached the forest on the farther side of
the river the blood had almost ceased, and following became a
difficult matter, as the footsteps of the wounded elephant were
becoming mingled with those of the other two bulls. It was
dreadfully hot, and for more than two hours we toiled along
over aloes and thorns and through tree jungles, covering about
six miles of ground before we again sighted our game.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>The herd was standing taking shelter from the midday sun
under three large trees which grew close together, and we
advanced to the attack. We could not make out the wounded
bull, so I fired at the head of the largest elephant I could see,
and the explosion of my rifle was followed by a loud answering
crack and a squeal from the herd, which soon became enveloped
in a dense cloud of dust. We ran on in pursuit, but they
slipped away and crossed half a mile of open stony ground,
passed a group of rocks which overhung a sand-river, and
stood half a mile off, in moderately high jungle. Climbing
the rocks I could see them, but following farther with my
lame leg was out of the question, so my two trackers offered to
go round and drive them to me if I would lend them my
Martini rifle and express and some cartridges.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I seated myself on a rock and watched the
herd. There was one very sick elephant in it, which seemed
to be continually rolling, surrounded by a group of sympathising
friends. I afterwards found this to be the bull first
wounded—the one which had surprised us on the river bank—and
he appeared to be in a dying state. While I was gazing
over the forest at them they suddenly began to move in my
direction very fast, and a moment later the breeze carried to
my ears the reports of musketry fired at a distance from
beyond the elephants. The herd disappeared for a minute
and then emerged from the high jungle and came over the
open, straight for my position; they then turned into the
river-bed and came past me at a great pace, at over eighty
yards’ distance. I fired right and left at the shoulder of an
old bull, the biggest of the three, carrying fine long tusks.
He fell and kicked about for a second or two in a cloud of
dust, and then turned up stream with the others, going very
fast. They then passed round my rock at about a hundred
yards, too far for straight shooting with such a rifle, and got
out of range, the badly wounded bull being no doubt among
them. There was one bull throwing sand over its back, which
I concluded must be the sick one.</p>

<p>My leg was now beginning to feel the strain of the day’s
work, and at the second discharge of the heavy rifle I was sent
flying, and subsided into a sitting posture among the rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the rifle dropping out of my hands. The elephants now sailed
gaily away over huge boulders and torrent beds with the
activity of monkeys, and soon disappeared over the brow of
a low hill, leaving me sitting on the rocks utterly fagged out.
When the trackers came up we went to examine the place
where the largest bull had fallen. The aloes were crushed to
bits and the sand was much scraped about, but we did not
notice any blood. The elephants had quite beaten us, and
we made the best of our way home, reaching camp at dusk
after a very tiring day.</p>

<p>For two days I had horsemen dogging the footsteps of the
wounded bulls, but they returned and reported that the herd
had gone past Little Harar and might not pull up for days,
having been thoroughly disturbed by the hunt. They had
followed the tracks of the sick bull for twenty-five miles, and he
had separated from the herd, halting to roll many times, and at
last his tracks had become mixed with those of a fresh herd of
bulls, cows, and young ones, and they had then left them. Rain
having recently fallen had made the tracking more difficult.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>On the night after this long elephant hunt we were awakened
at about twelve by two lions keeping up a deep roaring, repeated
at short intervals, which seemed to be uttered only thirty yards
from our fence, though in reality the distance was at least a
hundred, as was shown next morning by the pugs in the sand.
Luckily, neither my mule nor the three Somáli ponies were at
all nervous, or we should have had them breaking away. One
lion kept up wind, giving at first low grunts, growing louder and
ending in a roar, then dwindling down again to nothing. After
a bit he would be answered by a rumbling sound on the other
side, from a lioness concealed in the reeds down at the river-bed
close by. There was absolutely no moon, so we could do
nothing but replenish the fires with a stock of grass and sticks
which I always keep for this purpose. My men jeered the
lions, saying they were not in earnest or they would not make
so much noise. We had left some meat out within twenty
yards of our fence, but found it untouched in the morning, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
lions evidently fearing to come in so close, and only hoping to
stampede our animals.</p>

<p>I found Hembeweina very pleasant, and never tired of
wandering about near camp examining the fresh elephant
tracks in the river-bed. A herd which had lately passed had
made several wells or large holes in the sand, into which water
had trickled from the stream, and over these holes they had
stood to drink and throw water over their bodies.</p>

<p>One day I was out quite alone on one of these rambles,
and after crossing the river had ascended to the top of a plateau
half a mile from camp. The summit was a level plain covered
with black stones and occasional tufts of very green feathery
grass. Finding fresh oryx tracks I began to cross the plateau,
but the tracking was rendered difficult by the number of stones.
All at once I caught sight of a large animal moving slowly
among some bushes, evidently grazing and unsuspicious of
danger; and thinking that it might be an oryx, I began to
stalk up to it. This was not easy because of the transparent
nature of the bush; however, I got up to three hundred yards,
and imagine my surprise to find that the animal was a Somáli
pony alone in this bleak spot. This plateau had a bad reputation—the
nearest tribe to the north-west, seventy miles away,
being famous for raiding and lifting the cattle of the Abdul
Ishák.</p>

<p>By the side of the horse there was something on the ground,
which might be a man or a small ant-hill. Having on a former
trip had my caravan dogged by scouts from a tribe, I thought I
would cautiously investigate. So I crept up and found that
there was no man, while the horse, left to run quite wild without
bridle or rope on him, gave a whinny and trotted round me in
a circle with arching neck, nodding his head up and down. He
had evidently been abandoned by his rider, and I determined
to catch him, use him for work with elephants, and then take
him to the coast to be publicly claimed. Returning to camp I
brought up my people, and using the mule as a decoy, we at
last got a rope over his head and led him quietly to camp.
The day after the capture of the horse two men rode in to give
me news that Shiré Shirmáki, one of the Habr Gerhajis wise
men, was on his way from his karia, fifteen miles distant, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
visit me, bringing thirty horsemen with him, who, my informants
said, were his children. Then I witnessed the <i>dibáltig</i>, or
equestrian display, given in my honour, as the first English
visitor to their country.</p>

<p>In the distance, over the plain, arose a thin wreath of dust,
and from beneath it appeared first one or two horsemen, and
then about thirty, following each other in single file, and
coming on at a trot. Presently, as they approached the camp,
they formed line and broke into a canter, the spears flashing
vividly in the sun, and the bright red trappings of the horses
flaring out against the green thorn jungle. Each horseman
wore a <i>khaili</i>, which is a tobe of scarlet dashed with blue in
two shades, the colours being arranged tartan-wise. They
approached to within a hundred yards of the camp, and then
halted. Accompanied by my nine men, I left the zeríba and
advanced to meet them. Sitting on his pony in the centre of
the group was Shiré Shirmáki, a dignified-looking old man with
a white beard, and on either side of him were his sons, two or
three fine fellows in the prime of life. There were also one or
two boys, armed, like their seniors, with spears and shield, and
most of the men had slung round their waists the <i>biláwa</i>, or
short, close-quarter stabbing sword. All my visitors looked a
sturdy lot, up to lifting cattle or any other kind of devilry.</p>

<p>I exchanged with them the usual Mahomedan greeting, and
one of Shiré Shirmáki’s sons urged his pony up in front of the
rest and sang a long extempore song. When at last it had
come to an end I complimented the old fellow upon his warlike-looking
turn-out, and then waited in silence for him to explain
his visit. He said that, being encamped with his people and their
flocks and herds at a spot some fifteen miles to the eastward,
and having heard of my presence on the Issutugan, he had
come with some of his young men to visit me, sing songs, and
have a good time. “Yes,” I thought, “and to eat our rice!”
This was all very well, but our stock of food was scanty, and I
resolved to get rid of my friends on the first opportunity.</p>

<p>I now asked the old chief to show me what his children
could do in fancy riding; and at once two or three impatient
spirits galloped forward and threw their spears, picking them
up again by leaning over the saddle-bow while at full speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and then, pricking towards me over the turf, they pulled their
quivering ponies back on to their haunches with a jerk just as
they reached me, the mouths bleeding from the heavy bit. Soon
the plain around my zeríba was covered with rushing ponies,
their excited riders throwing their spears in every direction and
dashing forward to pick them up. Every pony raised a cloud
of dust to himself, and the confusion had reached its height
when the old man raised his hide whip as a signal, and one by
one they galloped up to me, till I was the centre of a semicircle
of horses’ heads, pressing upon me, their eyes aflame and nostrils
distended. Every man as he came up raised his spear and
shouted, “<i>Mót! io Mót!</i>” (Hail! and again hail!) and I
answered, with my men, “<i>Kul-leban</i>” (Thanks).</p>

<p>Many of these fellows can throw the spear about eighty-five
yards from the saddle or seventy-five yards on foot. They
guide their animals skilfully, but ride almost entirely by balance,
with very little grip on the saddle. After the display on
horseback we all went into the zeríba, and I gave orders to
have a big meal of rice prepared for our self-constituted guests.</p>

<p>Soon from across the plain came two more horsemen, and a
shock-headed boy leading a cow, which was brought in front of
my tent as a present, with Shiré Shirmáki’s compliments. We
killed it ten minutes later, and my men joined the strangers in
a big feed, followed by a firelight dance, the men clapping their
hands to the strains of a reed flute, advancing and retiring as
in a quadrille, and jumping up and down like men in a sack-race.
Then followed a few interesting step-dances and songs
in praise of the English or of the Habr Gerhajis. The burden
of one song was, “There is nobody like us; our horses are the
best and fly like the wind, and none can fight like we; our old
men are wise, our young men are brave as lions, and there are
no girls so beautiful as ours.” When I retired to my tent at
midnight the clamour was still going on, and I was roused
at 3 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> by the leave-taking. By the genial glare of our
camp-fire Shiré Shirmáki made an impressive speech, laying
great stress on my having seen his country, and asking me to
tell the English that his tribe, being very good people, never
molested caravans; to which I replied that, so far as my having
seen his country was concerned, he was perfectly free to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and see mine, and I promised him a new <i>khaili</i> from Berbera
and some snow-white <i>bafta</i> tobes for his men.</p>

<p>They recognised the horse which I had caught to be one
which had been abandoned by one of their fellows three months
before while engaged in a raid on the Jibril Abokr tribe, among
the mountains to the south-west. I promised, if they would
send a man to Berbera, that I would give up the horse to the
Resident there, and their tribesman might then claim it.
Finally, I apologised for not having shown them any equestrian
games on our part, as the mule was sick! After the joke had
been handed round and duly appreciated we parted with a great
deal of handshaking, and they trotted off into the darkness.</p>

<p>While shifting our camp next day back to Gulánleh, we
were constantly in sight of game, either oryx or one of the
three sorts of gazelle, and we caught sight of a leopard sneaking
across a nala three hundred yards ahead of us, but he disappeared
among some rocks, where tracking became impossible.
On arriving at Gulánleh I sent horsemen for a grand
tour to all the elephant forests around, and remained in camp,
ready to march to any point of the compass at a moment’s
notice. Besides my own trackers I had two parties of Habr
Gerhajis horsemen also searching for elephants, each party
consisting of three men.</p>

<p>While in camp at Gulánleh I was suddenly roused at noon
by shouts in Hindustáni of “<i>Máro, Sahib! Máro!</i>” (Shoot,
shoot). So pulling out my revolver, I looked round the fly of
the tent, and found my whole camp in an uproar; men were
running for their spears, and backing into one end of the
zeríba stood the Midgán, fitting a poisoned arrow to his long
bow and glaring viciously at one of my camelmen, who,
surrounded by his friends, stood at the other end of the zeríba
poising his spear. The situation was decidedly theatrical.
First I walked up to the Somáli and made him give me his
spears, and then returning to the Midgán I bundled him
ignominiously into my tent, poisoned arrows and all, and threw
him an oryx skull to clean, telling him not to leave the tent
without permission. Having thus satisfactorily disposed of the
centres of disturbance I held an inquiry, when it appeared that
the quarrel had arisen through my having persuaded my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Somális to allow the Midgán, who belonged to the outcaste
race, to eat with them out of the same dish. A young camelman
had, during a hot argument, told the Midgán that such as
he should not be allowed to eat with respectable Somális,
whereat sturdy little Adan rejoined, “Who are you to talk?
You’re only a baby; you have not learned to eat at all yet; go
back to your mother and drink milk.” The youth, having no
more arguments left, stooped, and picking up a spear which lay
beside him, leant over and prodded Adan gently in the back,
causing blood to flow. Rice, dishes, and men scattered in all
directions, and I had only come out of my tent just in time to
prevent the Midgán sticking an arrow into his assailant. The
Midgán was clearly in the right, and calling the camelman to
my tent, I ordered a slight compensation to be paid, and then
persuaded them to shake hands. These duels arise out of
almost nothing, and if a man should be killed, a blood-feud
between tribes, perhaps lasting for years, is the result. Luckily
the Somális, although quick to resent an insult, as quickly cool
down again.</p>

<p>About nine o’clock one morning one of my trackers rode in
to say that his party had struck the fresh tracks of a solitary
bull elephant in a nala some twelve miles to the westward, and
that they had followed him along its banks for eight hours, at
last finding him, feeding and standing about, at Eil Danan.
My informant went on to say that he had left his two companions
to watch the elephant. At Eil Danan a sandy river-bed
bordered by high reeds winds through a deep square basin
formed by the sides of the Eil Danan plateau, which is two or
three hundred feet high, and strewn with black stones like most
of the Damel Plain. Between the river-bed and the precipitous
edges of the plateau is black stony ground intersected by
watercourses, and sparsely dotted over with thorn bushes and a
few tufts of thin feathery grass, so that there is no cover for an
elephant to stand in except the reeds bordering the river-bed.
These are very dense and usually ten feet high, some of the
side gullies being choked with them, though in the main
channel, through which a small stream runs, they merely form
a fringe fifty to one hundred yards wide. Here and there near
the edge of the reeds grow a few large trees covered with <i>armo</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
creeper, on which elephants delight to feed; the leaves are very
green and juicy, heart-shaped and thick, having a smooth
surface like india-rubber.</p>

<p>Taking with me one camel and two or three men, I at once
set out for Eil Danan, and after a hot march we struck the
<i>wádi</i> at 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, and followed in the tracks of the two watchmen
until we found them. Then, after resting for lunch under
a tree, I went forward with my gunbearer, Deria Hassan, to
explore the reeds where the elephant had last been seen.
After some trouble we at length saw him standing under a tree
on the farther side of a belt of reeds forty yards wide. He
seemed to be a very large bull, and had a nice pair of tusks.
Beyond him the ground was quite bare. I crept up to the edge
of the reeds, and getting on the roots of a fallen tree, could
see his head above them. He was swinging it slowly from side
to side and looking quietly in my direction, though he did not
appear to see me. At last he presented his temple, and I fired
as well as possible from my insecure perch, hitting him a loud
smack, while Deria Hassan fired from the bank behind me.
Instantly the beast gave a shrill trumpet and charged, coming
straight at me through the reeds. Being in the open I did not
wait for his head to appear, but ran down the edge of the reeds
to leeward and dropped under a bush, Deria disappearing with
equal promptitude in the other direction. Then the three
horsemen, according to previous orders which I had given them,
rode up, and seeing them the elephant turned again into the
reeds and made off, keeping down the centre of the belt, the
horsemen riding parallel to him along the outside. I followed
on foot at best pace, and came up, a mile farther down, just in
time to see him charge viciously out at the horses, scattering
them. This manœuvre was repeated twice, and then the
elephant went up a side gully three hundred yards wide, choked
by an unbroken expanse of very high reeds. We here lost
sight of him for a time, and taking up his tracks we found a
good deal of blood.</p>

<p>On reaching the main channel I sent the horsemen on after
the elephant, and being parched with thirst I lay down flat
and drank from the rivulet. Before I had finished drinking
Deria said, “Look out!” and I heard galloping and loud shouts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and sprang up just in time to see the elephant break back and
cross the stream two hundred yards below me, taking up his
former position in the reeds, and followed by my three horsemen,
who were working admirably. When I came up the
horsemen were collected on some rising ground overlooking the
reeds, hooting at the elephant, which stood with the top of his
head just visible, listening to them.</p>

<p>Advancing to a small knoll in front of the horses, I fired
right and left at his head. He disappeared among the reeds
for a moment, and then some one called out that he was coming.
Out he came, very silently, and I slipped away to leeward and
crouched under a thorn bush to watch him. Off he went after
the horsemen, and singling out Hussein Debeli, following every
turn of the horse, he kept close behind its tail for two hundred
yards, till it seemed the plucky fellow would be caught, and
they disappeared among the trees together. I soon noticed,
however, that the elephant, having finished his charge, was
stealing back again towards the gully which he had first tried.
Back came the horsemen, and after a short race headed him,
and brought him to a standstill fifty yards from me, giving me
a good chance for a shot. I was standing in the open, and
knowing that I should have the watchful and angry brute down
on me at once if I failed to disable him, I fired at his head.
On receiving the shot he dropped his tail and trunk and held
for the gully, looking demoralised, but before he could reach
the shelter of the reeds I ran in close and gave him another
shot in the shoulder at twenty yards, while he was going at a
good pace. Swerving at this he plunged into the reeds, and
we heard him crashing about in them for some time, then a
long-drawn bellow, and everything became still.</p>

<p>Before going in I fired two shots with the express and
listened, but hearing nothing, we started to examine the reeds.
We were not long in finding the great cutting he had made
through them, and with rifle on full cock and every sense on
the alert, I entered, followed by my two trackers on foot. On
either side rose what looked like an impenetrable yellow wall;
wherever we looked we saw nothing but reeds, and as we
advanced we had to climb over the mounds of fallen stalks.
Yard by yard we pushed on, now and then stopping to listen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Along the floor and sides of the lane of reeds blood was plentifully
sprinkled, and at length we began to approach the place
where we had last heard him bellow; then I peeped round an
angle and saw him lying on his side quite dead, and we walked
up to examine our prize. He was an old bull, ten feet six
inches at the shoulder; we measured him with bits of reeds
which we afterwards laid beside a tape; and he had a beautiful
white pair of tusks without a flaw, four feet long, and thick for
Somáli ivory. Somáli elephant tusks are, as a rule, nothing like
the size of those found in the centre of the continent.</p>

<p>By the time the sun had gone down we had out one tusk,
and returned up the river to search the plateau for a camping
ground with good grass for the horses. Leaving the main
river, we formed our bivouac near a small grassy nala. The
arrangements for the night were quickly made, and, spreading
our blankets under the lee of a thorn bush, we were soon all
fast asleep. We had no fence, and at midnight I was awakened
by a lion roaring a short distance up the nala. Rubbing my
eyes, I awoke Deria, and told him to watch and keep the fire
alight, then I dozed off again, and when we awoke next morning
Deria was fast asleep by the fire, which was nearly out. We
cut out the other tusk and returned to Gulánleh, when, my leave
having expired, after skirting the foot of Gólis for five days, we
marched by easy stages to Berbera, then by dhow to Aden,
being becalmed for twelve hours in sight of the volcano before
getting in.</p>

<p>In order to show the state of Somáliland when the British
Protectorate<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> was first established after the departure of the
Egyptians, I propose to give a short account of my trips into
the interior prior to 1887.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon after I had joined the Aden garrison in 1884, two
English officers returned from a shooting trip to the Gólis Range
south of Berbera; this was, I believe, the first journey to the
Somáli interior undertaken by any Englishman since the attack
on Sir Richard Burton’s expedition thirty years before. Accompanied
by a friend, I was the next to make a short but unimportant
shooting trip to Gólis—in January 1885.</p>

<p>The first exploring party—that of Mr. F. L. James—had
preceded us by about a month, and was already at Gerlogubi
in distant Ogádén. The Egyptians had a few months before
evacuated the coast, the Pasha leaving with about half a battalion
of soldiers and a few field-pieces, and Mr. L. P. Walsh, one of
the assistant Residents at Aden, had taken over charge of
Berbera and Bulhár with a few Aden policemen. At the same
time Zeila was, so far as I remember, handed over by the
Egyptians to a British Consul, with a French Consul also living
in the town. My next visit to Somáliland occurred two months
after my return from the shooting trip to Gólis.</p>

<p>The Egyptian military quarters at Bulhár had been reported
flooded by a freshet from the Issutugan river, and I was sent
over from Aden to meet Mr. Walsh and go with him to Bulhár,
in order to choose a site for hut barracks, to be put up by the
Indian Sappers who were under my command. I chose the
site for the huts and returned to Aden. I arrived again at
Bulhár on 27th September 1885, with thirty Sappers and all
the material for constructing the huts, and camped near the
site which we had chosen. For the first three weeks there was
no chance of leaving camp even to go <i>aoul</i> shooting on the
plain. Several native reports had reached us that the hill
tribes, especially the Habr Gerhajis, were likely to come down
and attack us, and not knowing the nature of Somáli information
at that time I was inclined to believe these rumours.</p>

<p class="caption">Average length of horns on curve, 20 inches.</p>
</div>

<p>When the work was, however, fairly under way I took a few
strolls into the plain. On one occasion, when out, attended only
by my hunter, Ali Hirsi, we blundered within half a mile of a
large party of raiding Habr Gerhajis horsemen from the hills,
whom the police from Berbera were trying to catch. Not
knowing anything about the locality of the band I fired at a
bustard, with the result that the robbers bolted for the hills,
thinking the police had come up with them.</p>

<p>Bulhár was now getting full of people, the clans coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
down into the plain. Two of these clans had a feud in active
operation, and a large tree near Elmas Mountain was about this
time the scene of a ghastly murder. Eight men and as many
women and children of one of the clans were attacked when
asleep under a tree by their enemies, and all had their throats
cut. My hunter, Ali Hirsi, who belonged to the clan which
had suffered, promptly asked leave to go to the interior and see
his father, who, he said, had been suddenly taken ill. I afterwards
found that this was incorrect, and that Ali Hirsi, being
the son of an <i>ákil</i>, had found it incumbent on him to answer
the family call to arms.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards my friend the late Mr. D. Morrison,
Mr. Walsh’s assistant, arrived from Berbera to take charge of
Bulhár, and he at once found his hands full with this feud between
the two clans of the Shirdone Yunis, Habr Awal, called
respectively the Boho Shirdone and the Ba-Gadabursi Shirdone.
British interests suffer sadly by these feuds occurring near our
ports, as for the time being all trade is liable to be stopped.</p>

<p>A few days after M⸺’s arrival a messenger came
running in at dawn one morning to say that the Boho had
taken possession of the Bulhár wells, three miles west of the
town, and were that morning going to be attacked by the Ba-Gadabursi
from Elmas, each side being about five hundred
strong. M⸺ at once decided to ride out with his interpreter
and try to dissuade the Ba-Gadabursi from attacking.
I accompanied him on one of the Sapper mules, taking with
me Khoda Bux, a Panjábi muleteer, also mounted. After
going three miles, at the Bulhár wells we came upon the Boho
Shirdone halted, awaiting the attack. Here I found my hunter,
Ali Hirsi, sporting a <i>khaili</i> tobe, with a good nag grazing close
by. He came up cheerily to me, with nothing of the servant
about him, and shook hands. I asked him after his sick father,
and with a bland smile he said he had got well again, and was
going to fight the Ba-Gadabursi.</p>

<p>We rode on, and crossed a bare, undulating plain, which in
the evenings is sometimes covered with sand-grouse, and where
I had often hunted <i>aoul</i>, and a mile beyond the Boho we came
upon the Ba-Gadabursi, not halted, but already advancing in
line to the attack!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;" id="illus12">
<img src="images/illus12.jpg" width="460" height="340" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Somáli Horseman.</span></p>
</div>

<p>It was a stirring scene. About two hundred horsemen and
three hundred spearmen on foot were advancing in a long line
facing to the east, coming to meet us. The horsemen formed
the left wing, marching along the flat sandy plain which
stretched down to the raised sea-shore on our right, which,
though we could hear their roar, hid from our view the white
breakers of the Gulf of Aden. On our left the plain rose to
low sand hillocks covered with grass and scrub, and along these
came the right wing on foot, the men extended at about a
pace apart, keeping a very good line, each man carrying his
spears and shield and wearing his white tobe wound round
his waist. Most of the horsemen wore the <i>khaili</i>, or red and
blue tobe. The plain over which we had ridden stretched between
us and Bulhár, which lay four miles behind us.</p>

<p>Our little party of four cantered to meet this array. Now
and then a horseman darted out from the line, and galloping
round in a circle, threw his spear, and picked it up again while
at full speed. As we approached they set up a song, but
stopped when M⸺ rode up to one of the <i>aukál</i>, or elders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and demanded a parley. There was a good deal of angry
shouting at first, and the horsemen pressed round us in a dense
mass, so that we could only extricate ourselves by drawing our
revolvers. Seeing we really had some serious business on hand,
one or two of the leading Ba-Gadabursi elders, prominent
among whom was a well-known firebrand called Warsama
Dugál, entreated the horsemen to wait and hear what “the
Government” had to say. M⸺, by the aid of his interpreter,
quietly explained that if they would only put off the attack
for a day he would try and settle the feud satisfactorily to
both parties. While the interpreter was explaining this, M⸺
asked me to try and bring out the thirty Sappers, to be ready
on hand if required. I told Khoda Bux in Hindustáni, and,
like the sporting Panjábi that he was, he was delighted with the
errand, and kicking up his mule, he started off at a gallop.
A Shirdone galloped in pursuit, shouting and brandishing his
spear, but M⸺ quickly headed him, and persuaded him to
get back into the line and not make a fool of himself.</p>

<p>The elders, who had seen the force of my friend’s sensible
argument from the first, soon quieted down the horsemen;
while I rode off with Warsama Dugál and persuaded the infantry
to stop, for they were quietly creeping ahead among the
sand-dunes. When they saw me riding on a kicking Panjábi
mule, with a revolver which I had forgotten to put in its holster,
and old Warsama in company excitedly yelling at them, they
began to laugh, and good-naturedly squatted down on their
heels, with the butts of their spears planted in the ground,
glowering over their shields at a line of hillocks in front which
hid the Boho from view. At their earnest request I allowed
them to advance fifty yards to the top of the hillocks, “so that
they might see the Boho.” They said they were thirsty, and the
sight of the wells would do them good! The people told us
that it was very hard being stopped in this way. They did
not want to touch a hair of any white man’s head, they only
wanted to wipe out the Boho. However, the elders agreed to
send back the clan to Eil Sheikh, and themselves to come into
Bulhár with M⸺ and see what they could do to settle the
feud. The Sappers at last came into sight, and about a dozen
of the elders accepted our escort to get them safely through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the Boho lines. I extended my men, a section on either side,
marching in single file, while M⸺ and the elders rode
bunched together in the space between. We passed the Boho
line in this order, having first sent the interpreter on to
explain. The Boho looked savagely at our protégés as we
passed, but were too sensible to attack us for the sake of slitting
the throats of a few elders, so not a horse was mounted
and all went off quietly. Arrived in Bulhár, my friend rode
out with his interpreter and brought in the Boho elders. After
two days’ talking the feud was settled for the time being,
though it broke out again a week later, and gave M⸺ an
immense amount of anxiety and trouble. Twice my little
party was called out in aid of the civil power, but not having
to act in self-defence, we were able to keep the peace for a time
without firing a shot. M⸺ ordered the tribes to live
apart, the Ba-Gadabursi fourteen miles to the west at Eil
Sheikh, the Boho fifteen miles to the east at Géri, and every
few days or so he would persuade the elders to meet in Bulhár
for a conference. It was only a question of blood-money, but
what a question! We always knew how things were going,
for when the relations were strained the two semicircles of old
men who were seated on the ground would shroud their faces
in the ends of their tobes, only allowing a slit to look through,
and they would add the supreme insult of shading their eyes
with their hands; when things were improving they looked
their enemies frankly in the face.</p>

<p>Soon after the cessation of hostilities at Bulhár I was sent
surveying up the Issutugan river with an escort of fifteen
sabres of the Aden troop, a body of Indian cavalry which is
permanently stationed at Khor Maksar, the outpost near Aden.
This was my first exploring trip.</p>

<p>After this trip I returned to Aden to prepare for further
explorations in the Habr Awal country, and at the end of
December 1885 I arrived at Bulhár with three sowars of the
Aden troop, twelve mounted Panjábis, enlisted in Aden as
policemen for this special purpose, and ten sepoys of the Bombay
Infantry,—in all an escort of twenty-five men. Although
we were ready to start the survey by 1st January, the Bulhár
tribes were in such a disturbed state that M⸺, finding it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
necessary to utilise whatever troops came to his hand, was
obliged, in his official capacity in charge of Bulhár, to ask me
to remain, and to give him the benefit of the services of my
escort till the tribes should become more settled.</p>

<p>The Shirdone feud had broken out again, and some of the
Boho having managed to get into Bulhár to buy food, the Ba-Gadabursi
were reported to be coming in from Eil Sheikh to
attack Bulhár. M⸺ sent out notice that if they did come
in they would be fired at. One morning, while at breakfast,
we received news that the Ba-Gadabursi were actually in sight,
and advancing to the attack. I jumped on my pony and rode
out alone into the plain to reconnoitre; and seeing that this was
true, cantered into Bulhár again, and on my way to M⸺’s
quarters I called to the daffedar to turn out my fifteen mounted
men. When M⸺ and I came out again, both mounted,
we found my police ready and in the saddle, attired rather
curiously, for most of the men had only found time to put on
their turbans, and had their cartridge belts strapped over whatever
clothes they had worn when lounging about inside their
huts.</p>

<p>As soon as we had got beyond Bulhár we saw the Ba-Gadabursi
advancing slowly over the plain, about seven
hundred yards away, and reining in we fired a couple of rounds
from the saddle, and returned the carbines to their buckets,
then, drawing swords, we advanced at a gallop. The Ba-Gadabursi,
of whom there were over a hundred mounted and
about ten on foot, bolted at the first shots, and the horsemen
were soon lost to sight in the haze of the Maritime Plain,
while the men on foot, seeing themselves abandoned, tried to
hide in the grass, but were all caught by my men and brought
in as prisoners, only one being slightly wounded by a sword-point
through the arm. With the men were brought in seventeen
spears and some shields, which M⸺ gave to the
prisoners when he released them next day.</p>

<p>The Ba-Gadabursi were quiet for a week after this; and
then, on another morning, a runner came to report that they
were again coming in, in force, this time on foot. Our ponies
had all been knocked up by scouting for hill raiders in the
Selei direction on the previous day, so we called our available<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
men out on foot. M⸺ took command of the fifteen dismounted
policemen, while I collected my own sepoys and an
Infantry guard which was then stationed at Bulhár; they
amounted to about thirty rank and file, all belonging to
the Bombay Infantry. While the Ba-Gadabursi were still
quite a thousand yards away, M⸺, having drawn up the
police along the sea-shore, gave the signal which we had agreed
upon, firing two volleys at the distant line of a few hundred
natives. They bolted at once, and I had a running skirmish
with them for half an hour over two or three miles of grassy
plain, after which we lost touch of them altogether. We found,
however, some fifteen men hiding in the grass or diving about
in the surf, and one wounded man, and brought them all in,
with a collection of some thirty spears which had been thrown
away in the retreat. Most of these were given back next
day.</p>

<p>There was a lull after this, but on the following day half a
dozen elders of the offending tribe came in and called upon
M⸺, and we held a council with them outside his quarters,
a large crowd of spectators coming from Bulhár village to look
on. The elders, led by Warsama Dugál, explained that they
had no quarrel with the Government, but only with the Boho.
Their young men had, however, been boasting a good deal, not
seeing why they should be kept out of Bulhár, saying that they
didn’t care for the Government, and would go in and burn the
town. The elders had then given them Punch’s advice, “Don’t,”
but they had not listened to it. “Now,” said the elders to
M⸺, “you have fired upon our boys; that was bad of you,
but next time they will listen to our advice.” After we had
shaken hands cordially with them, for they were all personally
known to us, they rode away to Eil Sheikh. The wounded
man, who had only received a bullet through the foot, was put
under medical treatment, and in a few days limped out to his
tribe. Soon after the second skirmish M⸺ brought the
Boho and Ba-Gadabursi to a settlement, only to break out again
some months later.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, on 1st February I was free to start for the
interior on my survey trip. I had arranged to go in by So
Midgán and Eil Ánod to the Interior Plains, and thence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
strike through the Maritime Range to Bulhár. My caravan
consisted of eighteen Aden hill camels<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> with Arab drivers,
seventeen sabres of Indian mounted police, and ten Bombay
Infantry sepoys. We drove with us a small herd of Aden
donkeys, so that the sepoys could either ride or pack their
valises on them. We arrived at So Midgán, twenty-three miles
from Bulhár, at dusk, and next day we marched to Eil Ánod,
ten miles farther. We expected to come upon the Habr Gerhajis
tribe, which was supposed to be slightly hostile to the
British, and was noted for raiding; and as we passed the spurs
of the Sarar-awr (camel-back) plateau, on the way to Eil Ánod,
we saw the tops of the hills white with sheep and lined with
men, who were in a great state of alarm, shouting down at us.
Later we found a karia with only a few women in it, who said
all the men had run away, thinking we had come to loot them!
Knowing mounted men cannot climb hills, they had taken the
precaution to drive the flocks up, taking charge of them for the
time being, and leaving the women to mind the rest of their property
below.</p>

<p>We reassured these women, who then ran up and brought
down the men, and after a short conference the flocks were
driven into the plain again. The owners of the karia turned
out to be a <i>jilib</i> or family of the Habr Gerhajis, and soon an
intelligent-looking young man who had lost one leg came forward
mounted on a pony and shook hands. He was Deria Shiré,
the son of an important elder of the Habr Gerhajis tribe named
Shiré Shirmáki, whom I afterwards met and made great friends
with during the elephant-hunting trip described in the last
chapter. The latest news I have heard of Deria Shiré, who,
although a well-mannered young man, is rather a scoundrel,
was to the effect that two or three years ago he speared his old
father in the leg, nearly killing him. I found him very polite,
and he accompanied us to the wells, at the same time remarking
that he had not the slightest knowledge why we had come,
and that his tribe were very suspicious. No other white man
had ever been to Eil Ánod before, and he did not quite see
why we had come now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>We found a few men at the Eil Ánod wells, who received
us with black looks, and we took possession of one of the old
zeríbas and put a sentry over a well, which was reserved for
our own use. Deria Shiré left us, saying that he could not be
responsible for what his tribe might do; we had come armed
with guns and were strong, and he hoped we would leave him
alone. Meanwhile, as we were pitching camp, my interpreter,
Samanter, went down to the wells and got into conversation
with some of the tribesmen who were lounging there. He
came back to me in a great state of excitement, saying he had
reliable information that we were to be attacked that night, and
that I was to make a strong zeríba, and not leave camp myself
nor allow any of the men to do so.</p>

<p>There was plenty of game in the Eil Ánod plain, and
as I thought, if I followed Samanter’s advice, the Habr Gerhajis
would only be strengthened in their belief that we meant harm
to them, I decided to fortify the zeríba, and leaving fifteen men
inside, to sally out myself with the ten others, and beat the
jungle for game. We made a circuit of the bush within two
miles of camp, firing at the tiny <i>Sakáro</i> antelopes and hares,
and getting a mixed bag of three hares and six antelopes. At
dusk, carrying our game, we returned to the zeríba, on the way
passing a large tree where about a hundred and fifty men were
collected, all having their spears with them, and a few saddled
ponies were grazing round the tree. These people took no
further notice than to scowl at us as we passed.</p>

<p>After we had reached the zeríba I came out again with
two sepoys and the interpreter, and walking up to the tree where
the tribesmen were collected, I called out “<i>Salaam aleikum</i>”
(Peace be with you). There was no answer for some time, and
then an old man with a white beard and a wicked-looking, clean-shaven
skull, treated me to a surly stare and mumbled; “<i>Salaam</i>.”
Then he looked down and spat on the ground, and began absent-mindedly
scratching the earth with a bit of stick, and then
smoothing out the marks with his hands. The rest of the
crowd remained silent, all looking sulky and mischievous.
Some were gazing at us with a rude stare, others were shading
their eyes with their hands, or hiding behind their tobes.
My interpreter harangued them, asking why I was received so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
coldly by the tribe. There was a long pause till two old men
cleared their throats and looked at each other, and without
rising one of them spoke. “<i>Warya ninki Frinji</i>” (I say, foreigner)
was the beginning of his speech, and it was translated into
Hindustáni by Samanter as the old man went on.</p>

<p>The gist of his remarks was that the tribesmen wanted to
know why I had brought all these soldiers into the Habr
Gerhajis country, and whether we had come to steal cattle, for
if so, we had better go back again, as they had none. There
was plenty of cattle among the other tribes.</p>

<p>We had come, my interpreter said, on a peaceful mission,
to report upon the trade routes, and to ascertain whether they
were safe for caravans coming to trade in Berbera and Bulhár.
There was a good deal of loud discussion among the assembled
men, and then the old man who had first spoken, becoming
more friendly, said that he and his tribe knew nothing about
the looting of caravans. He accused all the sub-tribes around
of looting, but said the Abdul Ishák never looted, and I was to
tell the Government. At that time the Abdul Ishák, Habr
Gerhajis, were well known as the most persistent looters of
caravans, but I promised to convey the message to the
authorities, and made the old man happy. Peace was now
restored, and we spent a quiet night, the Abdul Ishák sending
us several vessels of milk; and in the morning we parted
amicably, and continued our trip, eventually reaching Berbera.</p>

<p>This incident at Eil Ánod, only thirty miles from the coast,
shows how little Europeans were trusted or known in the early
days of the British Protectorate. Many shooting parties have
been through the Habr Awal and Habr Gerhajis countries of
late years, but at that time the country was quite unexplored,
even close to the coast.</p>

<p>About a month after the Eil Ánod incident we set out
from Berbera on another trip, this time going to Mandeira, and
thence up the Jeráto Pass to Syk, in the high Ogo country.</p>

<p>I heard that the Kásin Ishák, a clan of the Habr Gerhajis,
were at Syk, and expected trouble; but when we reached the
Syk fig-tree we found only a few of the elders, who said that
they had received a good report of us from the Abdul Ishák
clan, which had met us on the former journey at Eil Ánod, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
so they had been waiting to receive us hospitably. I had left my
camp at Mandeira, about fifteen hundred feet below, and had come
up the Jeráto Pass with seven troopers as an escort. On reaching
Berbera we marched to Bulhár along the coast track, and on
26th April we made another exploring trip to the Interior Plains,
returning at the end of it to Berbera and thence to Aden, where
I completed my map of the Habr Awal country for Government.</p>

<p class="caption">A Moonlight Drink</p>

</div>

<p>In the following autumn, although not actually sent on
duty, I obtained six weeks’ leave to Somáliland, on condition I
would do a map of my route for Government. I was very
anxious to go to Zeila and make an exploration through the
Gadabursi hills, coming out at the coast again at Bulhár. So
far the hills between Zeila and Bulhár had been quite unknown.
On this trip I was in company with three friends, two of whom,
finding the game scarce, soon returned to Zeila. I held on,
however, and we struck without guides through the mountains,
finally reaching Dímis, near Bulhár, having traversed the last
sixty miles with only three pints of water per man. This
caused some suffering from thirst, which the men were able to
partly alleviate at Eil Sheikh by jumping into the sea and
moistening their skins. One pony died from the effects of this
march the day after we reached Bulhár.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>We had timed our trip at a bad season for game, and the
only satisfaction which I got for fitting out a very expensive
expedition, and for a good deal of hardship, was a map of
hitherto unexplored country.</p>

<p>In 1887 I made the two big game trips recorded in the
last chapter, and in 1889 a short shooting trip to Gólis, which
was of minor importance. In 1891 I was ordered to place
myself at the disposal of the Resident at Aden in order to
reconnoitre the trade routes in the Dolbahanta, Habr Toljaala,
Jibril Abokr, Esa, and Gadabursi countries. My brother, Lieut.
(now Captain) E. J. E. Swayne, 16th Bengal Infantry, whom I
will call E⸺, was deputed to assist in the survey, and joined
me at Calcutta as I passed through that place on my way from
Mandalay to Aden. We reached the Somáli coast in February,
and started with thirty-two Somális and one Madras “boy.”
There were twenty-six baggage camels, and we each rode a
camel led by a Somáli at walking pace. Going by Dubár and
Sheikh, we arrived after eleven days at Alla-uli, a watering-place
in a narrow valley just behind the crest of the highest
bluffs of the Gólis Range, at an elevation of six thousand feet
above sea-level.</p>

<p>On the following day, after establishing a small camp on
the top of Fodwein Bluff, we chose our theodolite station within
a short distance of the edge of Fodwein, which falls several
hundred feet sheer to the Mirso ledge below. This was the
first of a long chain of stations for fixing the main positions on
our route, by observations of the stars for azimuth and latitude,
with a six-inch transit theodolite.</p>

<p>We remained here four days, and obtained a good azimuth
on to a point on a small hill called Yirrowa, fifty-five miles
away to the east of south, on the main route to the Dolbahanta
country. Looking towards Yirrowa from the top of Gólis we
could see only one immense expanse of dark brown bush,
becoming quite blue in the distance and looking like a sea-horizon,
broken only by the small hill Yirrowa, and a long,
light blue line, dancing high above the horizon in the heat haze
and mirage, which indicated the Bur Dab Range, two days’
march beyond Yirrowa.</p>

<p>The whole of the country ahead was unmapped, the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
European caravans to go so far south being those of Colonel
Paget to the south-west of us, and of Mr. Clarke, which had
gone to the interior a few days before towards the south-east.
Eventually, however, we left both these caravans far to the west.</p>

<p>From our elevated position, which was now 6800 feet
above the sea, we had a fine view of the Maritime Ranges and
Berbera Plain, and we obtained a back azimuth on the Berbera
Masjid tower, thirty-five miles distant. It was very cold at
night, the thermometer going down to 58°, with a chilling
drizzle and clouds of mist which often enveloped us, making
observations impossible.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we marched back to Upper Sheikh, and
while we were camped near the graves at night, the mullahs
from Guldu Hamed ran to us crying that looters were coming
down on us. Men were seen running by, who said they were
Habr Gerhajis, and that their cattle had been lifted by a
neighbouring tribe. We remained under arms for a while and
then turned in. Next morning it transpired that the camels
had only been allowed to stray, and had afterwards been found.</p>

<p>We marched six miles to Dubbur, the last water before we
should reach Bér, about sixty miles farther, and filled up our
casks. Now we entered the great wooded and undulating waterless
plains, crossing the Habr Toljaala boundary soon after leaving
Dubbur, and always holding south-east. On the east a long
low range of hills shut in the view, but west and south of us
was one immense forest of small thorn-trees, except on the
margin of the sand-rivers, where some of the <i>gudá</i> thorn-trees
reached a height of fifty or sixty feet. In a river-bed, called
Goité, horsemen of the Habr Gerhajis, from Bur’o, came to hold
a mounted parade in our honour.</p>

<p>On 27th February we reached Yirrowa, and chose another
theodolite station. There were several curious flat hillocks and
cairns of stones, called Taalla Gálla, perched about the corners
of the Yirrowa Hill, and here we got an azimuth on to Bur
Dab Range, still blue in the distance.</p>

<p>At a thickly wooded pasture called Bér, five miles farther,
in the valley of Tug Dér, we found water at a depth of ten
feet in twelve wells. Very heavy floods sometimes come down
this valley, as can be seen by the large trunks of trees everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
stranded along the cut banks of the watercourse, which
is at places one hundred and fifty yards broad. The Tug Dér
freshets, coming from Bur’o, pass east into the Nogal Valley,
and so to the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>We were told that there were always from fifty to five
hundred robbers in the Bur Dab Range, and passing caravans
were often looted. It has been the custom of these robbers,
who belong to the Mahamud Gerád, Saad Yunis, and Músa
Abokr tribes living near the coast farther east, to loot across
this Bér Plain every year, going right up to Guldu Hamed.
When raiding they only water their ponies once in three or
four days. Near Bér we found tracks of forty horsemen, and
ascertained that they were those of a Dolbahanta force, which
a month before had gone to loot the Habr Gerhajis pastures at
Bur’o, but had been driven back, losing three ponies.</p>

<p>Several very ragged-looking Somális, with the usual spears
and shield, came into camp and insisted on being fed; they
had gone to Bur Dab to recover some camels looted from them
three days before, but on reaching the mountain they had first
seen vultures hovering about, and had then discovered the
robbers in great force sitting over a feast of the carcases of
the stolen camels; and being afraid to attack, they had returned
disheartened, hungry, thirsty, and tired. They told us that
Colonel Paget and his brother had their camp near Wadama-go,
ahead of us, where they were shooting lions. The Pagets had
already had one sharp skirmish with Bur Dab robbers, being
obliged, we heard, to use their rifles freely in self-defence.</p>

<p>We reached Kirrit well, near Wadama-go, on 3rd March.
There were numbers of old graves here, and the well, supposed
to have been dug out of the gypsum rock by ancient Gállas,
is very curious. At the mouth it is a hole twenty feet in
diameter, narrowing as it descends, with a rude cross quarried
out of the face. To get water, one has to descend twenty feet,
and then crawl along a narrow rocky passage for thirty feet to
a very deep pool, six feet wide and thirty feet long. It is quite
dark, and there is a strong smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, with
which the water is impregnated from the gypsum rock. The
water is disagreeable to drink, and causes diarrhœa. Robbers
from Bur Dab often use this well when on their raids. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
gypsum rock is very smooth and white, and in some places
presents the appearance of the flagstone flooring of a cathedral,
being split up into squares. The graves, which are made
of these rocks, are generally plastered over with powdered
gypsum.</p>

<p>Next day we marched across a broad tributary valley of
the Nogal to a flat-topped hill called Daba Dalól, eight miles
to the east. We crossed the tracks of Colonel Paget’s caravan,
and the next day we received a note from him concerning some
robbers whom he had taken prisoners.</p>

<p>Near Daba Dalól was a mullah’s village named Kob-Fardód,
with a little cultivation. These people told us that
the Mahamud Gerád were out against the Arasama, another
sub-tribe of the Dolbahanta, and that there had been a fight,
two days’ march ahead on our route.</p>

<p>Next day we had a scare among the camelmen. At noon,
while the camels and horses were watering at the well, two
miles from camp, under a weak guard of three riflemen, one of
them ran in to say they had been attacked and the camels
looted. E⸺ went out with a portion of our escort to search
for the missing camels; but they had only gone half a mile
when fifteen horsemen, the supposed enemy, cantered up and
shouted that they were Arasama, and that they had come three
days’ march to welcome us into the Dolbahanta country. They
told us that more than a dozen caravans were in their country,
afraid to go to Berbera on account of the Mahamud Gerád.
One caravan had even gone round to Berbera by way of the
Haud, preferring to go through waterless country and to carry
ten days’ water on the camels, rather than run the risk of being
looted. They also declared that we were the first Europeans
in this country, and denied all knowledge of some Italians
who were reported to have already come to Bur Dab. Here
we met gum-pickers, wandering about the jungle, collecting
gum in sacks. They seemed very poor, with old and rotten
tobes.</p>

<p>The Arasama, to whom we had given presents at Daba-Dalól,
followed us through the Ain valley, giving great annoyance
by loud-voiced demands for more. Wherever we halted
we were at once surrounded by a crowd of elders, clamouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
for tobes. They were dragged from hand to hand, with a
chorus of angry shouts, the bald-headed old chiefs looking like
human vultures.</p>

<p>We halted at a steep, flat-topped hill called Kabr Ogádén,
or the Ogádén graves, where a great Ogádén army once perished
at the hands of the Dolbahanta. The whole country was dotted
with Gálla cairns, one of these curious structures being visible
on every hill-top. From the summit of the hill we got a
splendid view of the broad Nogal Valley, and chose our theodolite
station at a Gálla cairn on the highest point.</p>

<p>Next day, followed by the Arasama headmen, still clamouring
for tobes, we marched to their great watering-place, Eil
Dab (rocky well). The tribe was here in strength, with
enormous droves of camels and ponies and flocks of sheep.
For a mile round the wells there were clouds of dust, kicked up
by the thirsty animals. The water in the wells, which are
caves in gypsum rock, was very foul. Vulturine guinea-fowl
abounded. We marched due south, crossing to the south side of
the Nogal, but we could not shake off the Arasama, who followed
us on their ponies, continually demanding presents and refusing
to be satisfied with what we gave. One old chief presented us
with a sheep, but not liking my return present of two tobes, he
crept into our zeríba at night and stole his sheep back, while a
friend of his engaged the attention of our sentry.</p>

<p>At our Biyo Ado camp more elders from other tribes joined
the Arasama, and while E⸺ and I were up the hill with the
theodolite, they issued forth and looted some camels of the
Allegiri tribe which were seen passing four miles out on the
plain. They also took three men prisoners, but we eventually
forced them to release both camels and prisoners. The Allegiri
brought us news of a fight between the Arasama and Barkad
Gerád on one side and Mahamud Gerád on the other, in which
the latter were successful.</p>

<p>Next day, while we were away watering our ponies, the
Arasama issued from our camp, and chasing two Allegiri, whom
they had seen from the hill, they brought them in as hostages
for exchange with some looted camels. Finding the prisoners
on our return we released them, and after turning all the
Arasama elders neck and crop out of camp, we gave out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
we intended to be friends with all tribes and would not be
mixed up in their quarrels.</p>

<p>Followed by a large number of avaricious elders, we marched
north-east to Badwein, where we found more wells, and a large
tank of water, four hundred yards in circumference, with perpendicular
sides forty feet deep, supposed to have been excavated
in the limestone rocks by ancient Gállas; but the water was
utterly unfit for human consumption. Ruins, which rise half
smothered from among a tangle of aloes and thorn jungle close
by, cover an area of forty thousand square yards, and in some
of the houses the walls are still ten feet high. E⸺ rode into
a large house or temple, to find it two hundred feet long and
one hundred feet wide, divided by a number of partition walls.
They are built of limestone and very much decomposed by
rains, and are supposed to be the work of the Gállas, but no
one knows who built them. Some of the Somális say they
date back to the time of some race before the Gállas. The
people at Badwein had just come from Gosaweina, driven from
there through fear of the Mahamud Gerád, and we were assured
we would most certainly be attacked by that tribe if we held
to our determination of going to Gosaweina. We were further
told that the plains were very open and the horsemen “as
numerous as the sand,” and that some years ago a force of
natives armed with one hundred matchlocks had been completely
wiped out there by a night attack.</p>

<p>Marching eastward, we soon entered the open grass plains,
where we saw the smouldering zeríbas of the Arasama and
Barkad Gerád sub-tribes, which had fled before the Mahamud
Gerád. The next day we held across the open plains to
Gosaweina, and scarcely had we started when a party of horsemen
was seen halted on some low hills to the north! We,
however, kept straight on, and the horsemen, constantly increasing
in numbers, followed us, moving parallel to us on the
higher ground.</p>

<p>Without halting the camels, we whistled the men up and
they formed line, and moved out to protect the caravan. The
horsemen came towards us at a gallop, but pulled up on our
running with a few men towards them. On getting up to them
my men were greatly relieved in their minds to find that instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the terrible Mahamud Gerád, they were a detachment
of the Arasama and Barkad Gerád, who had been out protecting
their flocks and herds at Eil Dab and Badwein by scouting
for the Mahamud Gerád. They followed us to Gosaweina,
clamouring for cloth, and hobbling their horses, they made a
bivouac on the plain with us at night. We did not light fires,
not wishing to attract the Mahamud Gerád. The horsemen
told us that rain had fallen in the plain to the north of us, below
Bur Dab, and that at Waredad there was a pool full of water.</p>

<p>We had now mapped the Dolbahanta country to the head
of the Nogal Valley, and the time had arrived for our return to
the coast.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> We ran the gauntlet of the begging Arasama elders
back to Eil Dab, and then struck due south, crossing Bur Dab
Range by a pass called Laba Gardai, which descended into the
Waredad Plain below. While we were in camp at Eil Dab
some of our escort, losing patience, began firing with blank
cartridge at the excited mob of Arasama who were pressing
round camp demanding tobes. The elders brought in what
they declared to be a wounded man, and made the occurrence
the text for a further demand that we should pay blood-money
or fight the tribe; but we found it was only an old half-healed
scar, and laughed at them.</p>

<p>A trading caravan, anxious to go to Berbera, but fearing
the robbers who infest Bur Dab, took advantage of our protection
for the next few days. In this caravan the women
were to the men as six to one, and had it been attacked when
alone it would have fallen an easy prey to a small party of
raiders. To place so much valuable property almost entirely
in the charge of defenceless women is putting temptation in the
way of the robber bands, and often the owners have only themselves
to blame.</p>

<p>We reached Arregéd, a deep ravine in the middle of the
Bur Dab Range, and during the night two men were seen skulking
in the bush near camp. On the 20th, taking three men and
a theodolite, I ascended Bur Dab, and choosing a station for
star observations, spent the night on the top of the hill. In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
morning before descending to camp we explored the interior of
the range, and found that all the plateaux of which it was formed
dropped sheer down into a large basin seamed by watercourses
and tunnelled everywhere by caves. The regularity of the
strata and their water-worn appearance led us to believe Bur
Dab to be composed of stratified limestone rock, and not a
volcano, as stated by some Italian travellers. Possibly they
confounded Bur Dab and Bur Dáb, the former meaning “rocky
hill,” and the latter “hill of fire.” The caves inside afford a
secure retreat for robbers, who, indeed, are said never to leave
the mountain.</p>

<p>On going down to camp I found that E⸺ and his own
followers had been kept on the alert throughout the night by
men prowling round them. They were distinctly visible in the
moonlight, but E⸺ would allow no firing, as they made off
whenever he went out to see who they were. On our return
to Berbera we heard that fifty robbers had reconnoitred our
Arregéd camp, and had made off westward for Kirrit, thinking
we had come to Bur Dab to look for them. For having been
severely handled in their attack on Colonel Paget’s party, they
did not care to come into collision with Europeans again.
Further native information was given us regarding this attack,
it being reported to us that the robbers had lost three killed
and ten wounded. As we did not actually visit Colonel Paget’s
camp, however, we could hear no reliable account of what
happened.</p>

<p>Marching through the Habr Toljaala country, we reached
the eastern continuation of Gólis Range and descended by
the Huguf Pass. Near Huguf we divided our caravan into two
parts; I marched to Berbera <i>via</i> Karam, while E⸺ ascended
Wagar Mountain, two days’ march to the west of Huguf, to
take observations. He marched over very steep and rolling
ground, gradually ascending, and then through a narrow gorge
to Sisai, at the back of Wagar. Sisai is a grassy hollow between
the two principal peaks of Wagar, which are called by
different names, the peak to the east being Bakáwa, and the one
to the west, and highest, Tawáwur (nearly seven thousand feet).
Everywhere the hills are clothed with thick vegetation, and the
grass is succulent and green, and many fat cattle of the Mahomed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Esa were seen. The trees are chiefly mountain cedar and
<i>hassádan</i>, a kind of euphorbia, affording a dense shade. The
party ascended Tawáwur from Sisai by a good path, passing
through heavy timber of cedar and <i>hassádan</i>, the soil everywhere
being hidden by the rich vegetation. About half-way
up the party reached a long glade of green grass two feet high,
which wetted them to the knees as they walked through it.
At the side of this glade the cedar-trees were straight, and
starting with a girth of from ten to fifteen feet, rose to a height
of ninety to one hundred feet, the <i>hassádan</i> trees also attaining
a height of about seventy feet. Opening out from this glade
in all directions were excellent paths through the forest made
by elephants, and plunging into one of them, they reached the
top of Tawáwur. They climbed on to an enormous boulder
capping the top. Looking over a vast expanse of white clouds,
they waited for them to clear away, but after four hours a dense
fog came up and necessitated a retreat. E⸺ saw countless
varieties of birds, and heard the voice of a panther come up
from the valley below, and at times koodoo antelopes could be
heard crashing through the jungle as the party advanced.
About thirty varieties of flowers were gathered, of great beauty.</p>

<p>E⸺ made two ascents of Tawáwur and one of Bakáwa,
and working down the spurs of Bergéli, he reached camp at Asseil.
It was very cold at night at Sisai, and the temperature throughout
the day was 70°, except at noon, when it rose to 78° Fahr.
E⸺ then descended again with his caravan to the plain below
Huguf, and marching to the coast, reached Berbera a few days
before I arrived by the coast route from Karam.</p>

<p>The expedition to the Dolbahanta country was followed by
a second to the Jibril Abokr sub-tribe of the Habr Awal, living
in the hills north-west of Hargeisa and in the open plains near
the Harar border. We took twenty-three men, of whom sixteen
carried rifles, and there were twenty-four camels. The caravan
left Berbera on 21st May, going south-west. We made a
moonlight march to Nasíya tree in the Maritime Plain. Next
day we came upon an immense cloud of locusts, which were
seen daily till the 26th,<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> often darkening the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 28th we ascended a plateau just under the crest of
Gán Libah,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> which is the farthest west of the Gólis bluffs, and
a most conspicuous landmark; and it was on the highest point
of Gán Libah, at an elevation of six thousand feet, that we chose
our theodolite station. We climbed the mountain to a point
some four miles south of the edge of the bluff, and camped; and
next morning I made an exploration through the cedar forests
to the highest point, from which the whole of the low country
to the north can be seen, including Berbera and Bulhár. I
found, however, that owing to the steep nature of the ground,
it would be impossible to get the theodolite uninjured to the
station which we had chosen. We subsequently found the three
points, Berbera, Bulhár, and Gán Libah, very nearly formed
an equilateral triangle, with a side of about forty-two miles.</p>

<p>The distance covered by the exploration was only eight
miles, but it occupied five hours, as the mountain was fearfully
cut up by deep ravines, while the high trees, growing close together
and festooned with creepers, thoroughly obstructed the
path. At the edge of the bluffs are cliffs on every side, and a
beautiful jungle with a great variety of flowers and plants,
especially nastertians, maiden-hair fern, and mosses. We struck
camp and made for the lower plateau, losing ourselves among
a network of steep ravines, but eventually we reached a plain
from which stood out a rounded rock called Dagah Kaburáleh,
and we camped in a grassy hollow at its foot.</p>

<p>Later on we struck south through the <i>khansa</i> jungle to
Bér in Khansa. E⸺ saw a lioness, but she bounded into the
long grass before he had a chance of getting a shot at her.
Leaving him at the Bér camp, I made a reconnaissance into
the open prairie of Toyo, sleeping out two nights without a
tent, and shooting for the first time two hartebeests, which
were afterwards found to be new to science, and being submitted
to Dr. Sclater, Secretary of the London Zoological Society,
they were described, and named Swayne’s Hartebeests (<i>Bubalis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
swaynei</i>). Returning to Bér, and finding E⸺ had gone, I
followed in his tracks, and halted for the night at a pasture called
Taláwa-yér, among the karias of the Kásin Ishák, Habr Gerhajis.
As I was riding ahead of the caravan, towards sunset, looking
out for a dead tree near which to camp, and so save labour in
collecting firewood, some karia people came running to report
that a panther had just struck down a goat, and had then been
driven off by the herdboys. I ordered the men to pitch camp
and walked over to the body of the goat. We built a screen of
boughs two feet high, taking ten minutes over the work, and then,
with the setting sun scorching our backs, I sat down with my two
hunters behind the screen, and only five yards from the goat.
Several men, who had helped us to make the brushwood screen,
then walked away towards camp, purposely talking aloud to
lead the brute to suppose we had all gone together; and while
they were yet only a hundred yards away I looked towards the
goat and saw the panther was standing over it, his tail towards
me. I fired, and hit him high on the left side, the bullet raking
forward, and he rolled over, and looking under the smoke I
finished him with a second shot as he lay twisting and growling
in the grass; and we carried him to camp and skinned him by
firelight. This was the first panther I had ever bagged, though
I had seen many. At dawn I continued the march, and arrived
at my brother’s halting-place before noon.</p>

<p>We made several marches westward, and on 8th June we
reached Hargeisa. This town is built some five hundred yards
from the right bank of the Aleyadéra nala,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and at an elevation
of thirty or forty feet above it. Round the place is a patch of
<i>jowári</i> cultivation (<i>Holcus sorghum</i>), two and a half miles long
and a quarter of a mile broad. Quantities of live stock of all
kinds graze on the low undulating hills for half a mile from the
Aleyadéra nala on either bank. Hargeisa is situated on two
important caravan routes, one from Ogádén and the other from
Harar. There are good direct camel roads to Berbera and
Bulhár. Supplies of rice, tobacco, and dates can sometimes be
bought here in the trading season. Some four hundred people
are employed looking after the <i>jowári</i> fields, and can be seen
sitting on platforms, shouting and throwing stones to scare away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the birds from the crops. There is abundance of good water
in the bed of the river, and a masonry well has been built, and
is kept in order by an Arab from Aden. The town is full of
blind and lame people, who are under the protection of Sheikh
Mattar and his mullahs. The soil is red alluvial earth with a
thin layer of fine sand on the top, and it is not better than that
which we had seen in the Tug Dér valley, at Bér, and in the
Haud. <i>Jowári</i> crops flourish here as they would in most of the
higher tracts of Somáliland, if the people were not in a chronic
state of petty warfare, and cared to cultivate.</p>

<p>At the time of our visit great anxiety was felt because the
Abyssinians occupying Harar had threatened to attack Hargeisa,
and had already exacted tribute of cattle from some clans of
the Jibril Abokr, Habr Awal. Sheikh Mattar told us that he
thought if the Abyssinians came down they would choose the
time of the harvest, six weeks later.</p>

<p>From Hargeisa we continued our journey westwards, camping
at Abbárso. Our tents were pitched five yards apart at
this camp, and as I was sitting outside in the balmy air, enjoying
the quiet moonlight scene, I observed a panther crouching
under the outer fly of E⸺’s tent, evidently stalking something
in the centre of the camp. Diving quickly into my own tent
for a loaded rifle, I came out again, only to find the panther
had sprung into the centre of camp and seized a milk goat.
There had been a crowd of men sleeping round the goat, and
to get at it he had leaped over them, placing his paw upon the
face of my brother’s cook, without, however, injuring him. On
the sentry running towards him with the butt of his Snider rifle
raised to strike, the brute dropped the goat and discreetly
sprang over some more men and out of the zeríba, and then
sneaked away. The same goat was killed by another panther
springing into camp a few nights later.</p>

<p>We separated our caravans on 14th June, meeting again at
Ujawáji on the 17th, among the karias of the Rer Yunis Jibril,
Jibril Abokr. The great subject of conversation among the
natives here was the expected approach of an Abyssinian force,
mounted scouts having been thrown out by the tribes, and
news coming in daily.</p>

<p>Near Ujawáji the country gradually became more grassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and open, the thorn bushes being only thinly scattered about
the plain. We passed a tree called “Mattan,” and two miles
beyond this tree, which was a conspicuous landmark, a long
hazy yellow line marked the commencement of the <i>ban</i> or open
grass plain, which is called the Marar Prairie. It was first
crossed by Burton, and is mentioned in <cite>First Footsteps in East
Africa</cite>. A conspicuous rock, called “Moga Medir,” or “Jifa
Medir” (Moga’s eye-tooth of Burton), lay ten miles to the west
of us on the edge of the bush. On the evening of our arrival
at Ujawáji we went out to shoot some hartebeests to provide
meat for the men. As we left camp the bushes gave place to
low scrub, and this presently ended also. Then a curious scene
presented itself to us. As far as the eye could reach was an
unbroken plain of rolling yellow grass, rising gradually towards
the north, and bounded twenty miles off in that direction by a
waving blue line of hills running along the horizon, and here
and there disappearing below it.</p>

<p>The plains were covered with the camels and ponies of the
Rer Dollol and Rer Yunis Jibril sub-tribes, the number of animals
giving one the idea of a swarm of young locusts moving over
the ground. Everything showed up dark against the background
of yellow grass; and single bull hartebeests, knee-deep
in grass, were seen wandering about between the droves of
camels, looking like black dots in the distance. Beyond the
masses of domestic animals we could see, far out on the plains,
long dark lines, which, by using the glasses, we made out to be
vast herds of hartebeests, oryx, and Sœmmering’s gazelles.
The rich soil, of a reddish brown colour, is here and there
undermined by burrowing animals and caved in, making galloping
dangerous. The white ants had built up the earth into
ant-hills, whose spires, from ten to twenty feet high, were dotted
over the plain. We shot two hartebeests, both good bulls, and
returned to camp with the meat and trophies, being caught by
a heavy downpour of rain on the way.</p>

<p>Early next morning we had to witness a great equestrian
display by the Rer Dollol and Yunis Jibril horsemen, given in
our honour. After the <i>dibáltig</i> they told us there had been
fighting at some wells near us the day before, the Gadabursi
having attacked them from the west, killing one man and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
wounding another; and also that an elephant had been killed,
not far away, by Midgáns, with poisoned arrows.</p>

<p>We had promised the Jibril Abokr that we would wait at
Ujawáji to hear further news of the Abyssinians, and to record
the complaints of the elders, for submission to Government;
meanwhile, having been told by the horsemen in the morning
that lions were numerous in the Jifa bush, we resolved to go
and look for them there, taking the camp with us. The Jibril
Abokr lent us horsemen to help us search for lion tracks, and
we started ahead of the caravan, sitting on camels which were
led by our gunbearers.</p>

<p>We got away from camp late in the morning, and besides
the men we had engaged, we were followed by a crowd of
horsemen, who were anxious to witness our shooting, and to
come in for a share of any venison we might obtain on the
plains between Ujawáji and Jifa. Soon we found ourselves
out in the open, masses of game giving way before us as we
advanced. The size of the party prevented our coming within
close range, but we wounded a bull hartebeest, and E⸺,
mounting one of the Somáli ponies, gave chase, with an Indian
hog-spear in his hand. The hartebeest is known to be the
most enduring of the antelopes, having a long and untiring
stride, and though E⸺ circled round the horizon, followed
by two horsemen, at a great pace, it gradually increased its
distance, and finally disappeared into one of the great wave-like
dips of the ground.</p>

<p>Presently a party of horsemen appeared galloping towards
us, now and then hidden by the rolling ground, and arriving in
front of our party they circled their ponies, and giving the complimentary
“<i>Mót!</i>” they came up and shook hands. They informed
us that they had marked down three lions in the grass,
on the open plain, eight miles away in the Jifa direction; and
they assured us the lions would be found in the same place, as
six horsemen had been placed to form a cordon round them,
and they would be afraid to move from the shelter of a patch
of rather high grass. The men said that these lions must have
been living within the edge of the Jifa bush, prowling out on
the great plains at night in order to stalk the herds of antelopes,
and that they must have killed something the night before, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
being gorged and lazy, the break of day had caught them while
still in the open, on their way back to the bush to lie up for
the day. These horsemen had been on their way to Ujawáji
from Jifa to perform the <i>dibáltig</i> at our camp, but seeing the
lions, and knowing that we were keen to get at them, they had
circled them in, and compelled them to sit down on the plain
and wait for us. Posting six vedettes, they had then come to
give us the news.</p>

<p>It was now about one o’clock and very hot, but we pressed
on, resisting all temptation to fire at any of the game around us
for fear of disturbing the lions; for a shot can be heard at a
great distance on these plains. Towards four o’clock we saw
one of the vedettes looming out of the haze, and then another.
It was, however, a long time before we could make out the
lions, which these men were trying to point out to us. They
were five hundred yards away, trying to take shelter from the
pitiless sun in a patch of grass about two feet high; all we
could see being two indistinct dark spots half hidden in grass,
and on one of these moving slightly, we recognised it to be the
head of a remarkably fine lion. Beyond the lions, more than
half a mile away, was another horseman, sitting motionless in
the saddle, and looking like a waving palm-tree, the horse’s legs
appearing to be elongated in the haze and mirage.</p>

<p>The Somális who had been watching the brutes said they
had been in this spot all day, getting up to roar now and then,
but, knowing by experience the powers of the Somáli horsemen
in the open, they had not attempted to make a bolt of it towards
the distant bush, which loomed up in a quivering blue line some
ten miles to the north of us. Considering the heat of the sun,
and that they had neither food nor water, these horsemen had
stuck to the lions with great perseverance, and we felt that
we owed it to them to crown their hard work by straight
shooting.</p>

<p>We guessed that the brutes must be in an uncommonly bad
temper after having been kept out in the full glare of the sun
for ten hours; for lions like to sleep under the shade of dense
bush during the heat of the day. The grass in this part of the
plain was fresh and green, and looked almost like an English
lawn, there having been rain about three weeks before. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
dismounted, and my brother and I, each accompanied by one
Somáli, walked towards the lions.</p>

<p>The account of what followed is taken partly from what I
saw, and partly from E⸺’s verbal description; for, being
unconscious part of the time, I was not in a condition to know
all that passed.</p>

<p>As we approached within two hundred and fifty yards there
was a commotion in the grass—a fine black-maned lion sprang
out, and was immediately followed by another, nearly as large,
but with a yellow mane. They both stood up and looked back
at us for a moment and then trotted away. We walked after
them, hoping they would lie down again; but as we passed to
the right of the patch of grass where they had been lying, and
at about a hundred yards’ distance from it, I saw a lioness
stretched out flat, with her head between her paws. She was
facing us, and as we passed her she rose for a moment, and
then glanced towards the retreating lions, but she crouched
down again, her head just visible above the grass, and never
ceased growling savagely. We went straight on at the same
pace, till we were between her and the line of retreat. She was
growling louder and louder, and I walked across her front to
get a chance at her left shoulder, while E⸺ stood ready,
when she rose, to fire at her chest. We stood seventy yards
apart, the lioness being seventy yards from each of us, our three
positions thus forming an equilateral triangle. The lioness
moved, and E⸺, calling out that he could see her chest,
immediately fired.</p>

<p>The bullet hit her too high, and, as we afterwards found
out, in the withers clear of the spine, the wound causing her
to spin round like a top several times in a cloud of red dust,
as if hunting her own tail, so that I could see nothing to fire
at. From the disturbance in the grass and the savage growls,
we decided she must be mortally hit, and were preparing to
walk up to her, when suddenly from the obscuring dust she
came out, charging for me at full speed. She ran extended
along the ground, like a greyhound, and came so fast that I
had only time to raise my rifle, and when the bead of the
foresight was somewhere under her chin, I fired. Quickly
shifting my finger to the left trigger when she was only five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
yards away, I pulled again, and then jumped to one side, the
rifle still at my shoulder. I remember nothing more, except
that her head came through the smoke and I was half conscious
of being lifted off my feet and sent flying through the air, with
the lioness hanging on to my shoulder, growling horribly!</p>

<p>On coming to, I found that I was standing up streaming
with blood, and E⸺ and the two hunters were helping me
off with my shirt, the lioness lying dead on the grass at my
feet. There were eight deep fang wounds in my right arm
and shoulder.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> My brother probed them with a bit of stick
wrapped in a shred of tobe; and then we looked around for
the lions, and saw that they were no longer visible; but E⸺
said that all the horsemen had followed them, intending to
ride them to a standstill and force them to come to bay.</p>

<p>My wounds, owing probably to the severe shock and
weakness from loss of blood, gave me no pain, and when a
Somáli came galloping back and offered my brother a pony,
saying that the lions had come to a standstill, I begged him
not to bother, but to try and bag the big black one. I
remember hearing E⸺ gallop away, and then I must have
fainted.</p>

<p>When I came to again, I saw my hunter, Jáma, sitting
near me on the body of the lioness, unconcernedly scrubbing
his teeth with a bit of <i>athei</i> stick, which he must have
brought from Ujawáji. He said he had been waiting for me
to wake, and to tell him what was to be done next. The other
“Sahib” had gone away, but Jáma had heard a very distant
shot, and concluded he must have come up with the lions again.
But he advised me to wait for the caravan, which he could see
coming over the plain from the east, and mount a camel before
trying to go any farther.</p>

<p>When it came up, all the men crowded round, with horror on
their faces, and asked which of the Sahibs had been killed, but
I got up and said, “Neither,” and mounting a camel, directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the camelman to follow the hoof-marks of the ponies in the
turf. How I managed to sit on the camel in my weak and
dazed condition, I do not know. I must have dozed, for the
next thing I saw was a group of dismounted horsemen in front
of my camel, and my brother standing over the most splendid
black-maned lion I have ever seen.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>I attribute my not having stopped the lioness to the fact
that I had been shooting with a very good .577 double rifle,
but in the course of our journeys the triggers had become
rather stiff, making me jerk them off; and both my bullets,
going low, had passed through the brute’s right foot, making
small clean wounds, without expanding. E⸺, who had his
gun open and was pushing in a fresh cartridge, had been
horrified to see both my shots strike up the ground beyond
the lioness.</p>

<p>Our two hunters, unlike most Somális, who are not generally
a bit afraid of lions, had retired to a little distance. E⸺ said
that after firing the second shot I had jumped to the right
in a perfectly collected manner, but the lioness had slewed
round her tail like the rudder of a boat, and slightly changing
her course, she had hit me like a battering ram and sent me head
over heels. The stock of the rifle was afterwards found to be
badly smashed, either against my shoulder or by falling on the
ground, and a patch of skin off her nose showed where the
muzzle had apparently caught her as I held the gun at the
“present” after firing. There was also an extensive bruise,
about the size of the recoil-pad, on my right shoulder. The
lioness lay on me, shaking me savagely and grabbing at my
arm, and E⸺, finding he could not fire without the chance
of hitting me too, decreased his distance at a run from seventy
yards to only five; and she then came for him with a grunt,
and he stretched her dead at his feet with a bullet in the
chest.</p>

<p>When my brother, having left me in the care of my hunter
Jáma, galloped after the other horsemen, he found them halted
round a tuft of high grass, having run the lion to a standstill.
The horse was the same which he had ridden when chasing
the hartebeest, and it had become very lazy from the heat of
the sun. The saddle was an uncomfortable doubled-peaked
Somáli one, and the stirrups being only intended for the big
toe, were of course useless to him. Thus sorrily equipped,
E⸺ walked the horse forward cautiously towards the tuft of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
grass, and while he was still sixty yards from it, the lion
poked up his great head to have a look at him. E⸺ pulled
in, and, dropping the reins, took a shot into the grass where he
judged the lion’s chest to be. The brute promptly came on,
and E⸺ had only time to pick up the reins in a bunch and
turn the pony round, and try to get him to move by belabouring
him over the quarters with the barrels of his rifle, when the lion
arrived! My brother escaped unharmed, however, for before
he could get into position to fire, the lion pulled up, and fell
over on his side gasping; and the next moment he was
dead.</p>

<p>When we cut him open we found that the shot fired at him
when in the tuft of grass had entered his chest, and when we
held the heart up to the light a jagged hole showed where a
piece of lead had passed through it. Yet he had galloped fifty
yards, and nearly made good his charge before giving in.</p>

<p>We sent a camel for the lioness, and laying the two carcases
side by side, we pitched camp close by. Some starving
people, who had wandered from Harar, were glad to make a
meal off the carrion. The third lion escaped, as the Jibril
Abokr horsemen, feeling that while we were in this country
they were responsible for our safety, and shocked at the state
I was in, refused to take my brother after him. On the day
after the accident we were delayed in the morning by the
bandaging and doctoring which I had to go through. The
only thing we had with us was cocoa-nut oil, which we had
brought for the lamps of the theodolite, and I don’t think its
application did the wounds much good. In the plain round
the tents, a quarter of a mile away, were brown and gray
masses entirely composed of hartebeests and oryx, and nearer
were a few solitary bulls, which loomed up on the swelling
ground and disappeared in the hollows, like ships on the
horizon, and their shoulders being much higher than the
quarters, and the legs hidden in the grass, they appeared to be
sitting up. We counted seventeen ostriches as they suddenly
appeared out of the haze, and passed in single file, at a great
pace, half a mile off.</p>

<p>In the evening, the sky being overcast and the air cooler,
we marched five miles towards Bottor wells, on the direct road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to Gebili. Next day we got off the open <i>ban</i> into the thorn
jungle, and descended into a grassy hollow at the head of the
Bottor Valley. Here there were numbers of high birch-trees
covered with kites’ nests—a noticeable feature of this valley and
easily seen from a distance, the upper branches being bare and
the nests looking like globe signals.</p>

<p>The Ujawáji people, on hearing of my accident, sent several
messengers to inquire how I was getting on, and horsemen
came from most of the Jibril Abokr clans which were pasturing
in the neighbourhood, to <i>dibáltig</i> to us before our start for the
coast. We held a council of the elders, when the complaints
against Abyssinia were taken down by us for transmission to
Government.</p>

<p>All these elders professed great personal friendship for
ourselves. They said they had been asked for tribute by the
Abyssinian leader Banagúsé and had refused it, and were now
expecting that a force would be sent against them. The tribe
had therefore retreated across the Marar Plain from their
pastures, near the curious conical Subbul hills, which could be
seen twenty miles away rising out of the plain; and they had
been obliged to graze their animals on the poorer pasture at
Ujawáji. The elders said that the Abyssinians had pushed out
and built a fort at Jig-Jiga, about forty miles south of us, within
the farther edge of the Marar Prairie.</p>

<p>On 21st June we passed through Gebili, and reached a spot
in thick jungle with aloe undergrowth, called Armadader. On
pitching camp here in the evening we found fresh elephant
tracks, and E⸺ followed them, returning after dark, having
killed a bull with one shot from my four-bore.</p>

<p>We continued our survey through the very mountainous
Jibril Abokr country towards the coast, running the gauntlet of
the Rer Haréd clan, which was at that time very turbulent and
defiant towards the British. We had several night alarms,
being surrounded by Rer Haréd spies during our march, but we
were not attacked.</p>

<p>By the end of June my wounds were beginning to become
very troublesome, my right arm swelling to the size of a small
sand-bag, from the shoulder to the wrist, and giving me great
pain. Travelling became almost unendurable, the sterile, broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
hills being fearfully hot, the temperature rising to over 110° in
the shade at certain places. We had now descended to the low
coast country, where the south-west wind of the <i>Haga</i> season
was at its height, blowing day and night with great fury. It
was impossible to put up a tent at night, and the sand got into
eyes and ears, and stung our faces and necks in a most disagreeable
manner as we marched along. The only way to obtain
any sleep was to pile the baggage into a heap and lie under the
lee of it.</p>

<p>Since leaving Ujawáji E⸺ had sole charge of the survey,
as I was unable to take observations. When we were still ninety
miles from Bulhár, fearing that any longer delay in getting
medical help might bring on blood-poisoning, I left E⸺ in
charge of the expedition, and mounting a camel, accompanied
by a few of my servants, I made for Bulhár by forced marches,
reaching the village on 1st July, twelve days after the accident.
Here I was glad to find an hospital assistant, a native of India,
who looked after the wounds and put me in a fair way to recovery,
so that the necessity of going to Aden was obviated.
I was never under the care of a qualified doctor, and was able
to go on with the mapping at Berbera, and to start on an
expedition to the Gadabursi country on 10th September, the
wounds having just healed. This record of our Jibril Abokr
trip shows what an advantage it is to have another European
with one in the interior, for I feel sure the lioness would have
finished me if my brother had not come promptly to the rescue,
and but for his unremitting care after the accident I think I
should never have reached the coast.</p>

<p>On our next expedition for the survey of the Gadabursi
country, our route, skirting to the north of Hargeisa, passed
through Gebili. We crossed the path taken by a powerful force
of the Rer Haréd, Jibril Abokr, who were out raiding the
Bahgoba sub-tribe, and I came upon some of the robbers in
rather a curious manner.</p>

<p>Our caravan was marching from Gebili to a small hill called
Bohol-Káwulu, while with four hunters I took a short cut across
a deep valley, the direct distance being four and a half miles.
We had passed the Gebili sand-river and were working our way
up some low foothills, intersected by deep narrow ravines having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
perpendicular sides, and choked with thorn jungle, when I
observed about fifty vultures circling over a tributary gully.
Thinking a lion might have killed a koodoo, we made our way
towards the place, and found ourselves at the foot of a platform
of ground having nearly perpendicular sides, about forty feet
high. It was above this little plateau that the vultures were
circling, and climbing noiselessly up I peeped over, expecting
to see some dead game.</p>

<p>Instead of this, about thirty yards away were about fifteen
men sitting in a circle round a fire eating camel meat, which
they had been roasting, the carcase of a camel lying close by.
One of the men saw my head above the edge of the platform,
and all of them, giving a look of horror, snatched up their spears
and shields and bolted, only a few having the presence of mind
to take away pieces of meat! I jumped up and shouted to them
to stop, but they disappeared; and soon afterwards we obtained
a glimpse of their white tobes as they topped a crag a mile
away, still running hard; and after that we never saw them
again.</p>

<p>We saw vultures several times during the next two marches,
and once again I came to a smouldering fire and roasting
meat, which had been thrown down in a hurry. The vultures
had been circling and screaming above the place, but as we
approached they all slanted down one after another, wings
extended and motionless, and legs hanging perpendicularly,
showing, in the language of the jungle, that human beings, or
perhaps a lion, had been keeping them from the meat.</p>

<p>Two of our men, who had lagged behind the caravan, saw
another party of twenty men running along with camel meat
slung over their shoulders. All these parties were Rer Haréd
robbers who had been engaged in the late raid, and were retiring
in groups with the stolen Bahgoba camels. The raiding tribe
always attacks unexpectedly in a concentrated force, but on the
return journey through the enemy’s country it splits up into
small parties, taking to the most hilly ground, and hiding in the
deepest gullies to avoid observation. Our men were always
very nervous while in the neighbourhood of these robbers; and
at our night camp at Bohol-Káwulu our Jibril Abokr guide,
rattling his spears together, shouted out a long speech into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
darkness, telling any lurking robbers that we had guns and,
being very powerful, were not fair game. The performance
was gone through quite gravely, all the other men maintaining
silence; the flames of our camp fires glinting on the rifle-barrels
and spears of our followers, and throwing fitful lights
and shadows on the surrounding jungle, and the guide’s speech
to the night, had a very weird effect.</p>

<p>When we entered the Gadabursi country we were visited in
camp at Egu by a party of Gadabursi elephant hunters, who
rode up and said they had taken us for looters and had come
up to reconnoitre us. We reached the Harasáwa Valley, which
was very beautifully wooded, the undergrowth of red and yellow
flowering aloes harmonising with the light green masses of the
<i>ergín</i> plant, the dull yellow-ochre of the dry grass, and the
darker blue-green of the thorn and <i>hassádan</i><a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> trees. On the
evening of 25th September we passed, near Sattáwa, the karias
of Ugaz Núr, till lately the paramount chief of the Gadabursi
tribe. This was the most suitable place we had yet seen for
experimental cultivation, the Sattáwa Valley having a fertile
appearance, with deep alluvial earth and very rank vegetation.</p>

<p>As we halted at Sattáwa, at sunset, to form camp, there
appeared on the scene Ugaz Núr, his son, and forty spearmen.
He stayed in camp all night, and told us not to go to Biyo-Kabóba
in the Esa country, which lay ahead of us, as he said
the place was full of Abyssinian soldiers, who were building a
fort there, and would be likely to attack us. Núr was believed
to be an arch scoundrel, and intriguing with the Abyssinians,
and we were inclined to think he gave us this advice to prevent
our inspecting the fort. He was then in great disgrace with
the British authorities because he had captured an Italian
traveller and held him to ransom. He had just been displaced
from the Ugazship, and his brother Elmy had been made paramount
chief of the Gadabursi in his stead. While we were in
his camp we heard that his brother Elmy was marching against
him with a force from Zeila; and soon afterwards I received an
Arabic letter from Elmy himself asking me to help him attack
Núr, or, at any rate, lend some rifles. One of the Ugaz’s sons
a youth with a large shield, a mop of hair, and two shovel-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
spears, gained some importance in camp by strutting
about taking frequent oaths that he would kill Mr. Sala, an
Italian traveller, when he met him.</p>

<p>We left the Gadabursi and entered the Esa country,
cautiously skirting Biyo-Kabóba without going to the wells.
We found the Esa tribes in a great state of ferment because of
the fort which the Abyssinians were building.</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> on 30th September, at Arroweina, there arrived
a grizzly-bearded old patriarch called Múdun Golab, an Akil
of the Odahghub, Rer Gédi, Esa Ad.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He made an impressive
speech, saying, “It is a lie that any of the Esa countenance the
Abyssinian occupation of Biyo-Kabóba. We all hate them
and do not want them. The English and the Esa are brothers,
and we are the subjects of your Government. So we ask you
now to rid us of these intruders. They wish to treat us as they
treated the Géri, to seize our flocks, kill our people, and burn
our karias. They wish to settle in our country and oust us.
We will not have it.” He said that the Esa were encamped
round the Biyo-Kabóba fort, and that they were holding a
council, one party, consisting chiefly of young men, wishing to
attack at once. He asked us to wait and hear the result of the
council, and convey news to the British authorities.</p>

<p>On 2nd October, the council not yet having come to a
decision, we continued our journey through the sterile trap
country to the north, and then turning to the east, we skirted
the Bur Ád Range as far as Ali Maan before again turning
north for the march to Zeila.</p>

<p>On 5th October, as we were arriving, late on a dark
night, at Hemál under the Bur Ád Range, we got into very
dense and high <i>gudá</i> forest, bordering the edge of the Hemál
sand-river. Our camels were pushing their way through the
centre of this when we heard the scream of an elephant about
a hundred yards to our left, followed by that of another a little
in front. The caravan bunched up in the narrow path, and we
all held our breath to listen. Our elephant rifle was carefully
packed up in one of the camel-loads; the jungle was stirring all
round us as the herd moved off. They seemed to have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
away, and the camels had begun to resume their march, when
we were thrown into confusion by hearing a crash, as some old
cow, for it is generally these that are the most vicious, charged
up towards us with a scream, and then stood a short distance
away behind a tree. Some of the men whispered that they could
see her, but though my brother and I strained our eyes to the
utmost, we could see nothing. At last we moved away from
the uncanny spot, and as no further incident happened, we
concluded the elephant which last trumpeted must have been
covering the retreat of the herd, and have stolen away silently
after the others.</p>

<p>Next day my brother went after these elephants, and
stalked in amongst them by creeping through a high grass
glade, but finding they were all cows and young ones he did
not molest them. Meanwhile half a dozen sword-hunters, of
mixed tribes, came to our camp. One of these was a Gadabursi,
another a Habr Awal, and the rest Ogádén. Their ponies
were excellent, and better than any we had yet seen among the
Gadabursi.</p>

<p>They were after the elephants which my brother had been
stalking; and while in our camp they described to us their
method of working.</p>

<p>Like the Hamran Arabs described by Sir Samuel Baker in
his <cite>Nile Tributaries</cite>, they ride after the elephant and hamstring
him with a sword, one man keeping in front on a white horse to
attract the elephant’s attention. I believe the Somális use the
sword while at full gallop, without springing to the ground, but
of this I am not certain. The sabres we saw seemed to be light
single-handed ones, an old Egyptian blade being strapped to a
bone handle by means of raw hide. These men said they had
killed twelve elephants during the last two months,—eleven bulls
and one cow,—and that since their party began hunting the year
before two men had been killed by the elephants.</p>

<p>We continued our journey from Hemál to Ali Maan, where
I shot a fine koodoo bull. At Ali Maan we separated into two
parties. I marched to Bulhár by Kabri Bahr, while my brother
marched to Zeila, reaching that port on 19th October. At
Buk Gégo he bagged, with one shot, a bull elephant, a very fine
tusker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The record of these Government explorations undertaken
between 1885 and 1891 shows how steadily British influence
has been advancing. At the time of my first visits to the coast
none of the routes in Guban were safe to travel on without a
powerful escort, except the track along the sea-shore from Bulhár
to Berbera. All this is changed now, for such is the confidence
which Somális have in our countrymen, that Englishmen exploring
in the interior make small payments for sheep, milk, or
other supplies, by writing on scraps of paper, to be afterwards
presented at the coast; and these “chits” have all the value
of money, although they may have been given by an Englishman
who is a perfect stranger, at a distance of two hundred
miles inland. The possession of a bit of paper written on in
English is believed to guarantee the safety of the bearer’s
life, and we have often been begged for scraps of paper by
men who wished to go alone by a short cut over disturbed
territory.</p>

<p>The Somális have no quarrel with the English; even should
a serious cause of dispute ever arise, there is far too much
hereditary jealousy between tribe and tribe for them to combine.
It is true the Esa caused trouble a few years ago by their raid
on Bulhár, but this raid was directed against the Habr Awal,
and not against the British. The punishment which they
received from us, by their own showing, turns out to have been
greater than was at first supposed, and they now declare themselves
to be our firm friends.</p>

<p>In the surveying trips the opposition to our progress by the
tribes was practically <i>nil</i>, unless the extreme avarice and rapacity
for presents on the part of a few Dolbahanta chiefs may be
called opposition. In fact, the only occasion on which I have
been treated with the slightest want of cordiality by Somális
was on my second surveying trip in 1886.</p>

<p>I think there are three reasons why the British Government
is so much respected in the interior of Somáliland. The first
is undoubtedly the possession of Aden, about half the population
of which is composed of Somális, who return to their own
country after a time and spread the fame of the Government
far and wide. Also, a few Somális go to London as firemen
in English steamers. Another reason for the rapid extension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of British influence is the wise and impartial way in which our
coast ports have been administered by experienced political
officers from India. The third reason is constant contact with
English sportsmen, who visit the Somáli tribes in their own
homes.</p>

<p>The capture of Harar by the Abyssinians in January 1887
was an important event to the Somális, because, under the
Emir Abdillahi, Harar had hitherto been a very effective little
“buffer state” against Abyssinian encroachments. When the
British Government first took over the Somáli coast in 1884
there was no Abyssinian question, and the authorities had only
to deal with the Somáli tribes, which, although turbulent, were
in fair equilibrium as regards power. Of late years, however,
the Abyssinian question has risen into some importance, as will
be seen by the narrative of later trips. The Abyssinians import
large quantities of breech-loading small-arms from ports west of
Zeila and outside the British Protectorate, while the Somáli
tribes are only armed with spears or bows and arrows, and
are not allowed to import firearms, of any sort whatever, from
their own coast, which is administered by the British. Hence
the equilibrium of power is affected, the Abyssinians help themselves
to Somáli cattle when they like, and the owners, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
are all Mahomedans, turn their eyes towards us for protection
against their natural enemies. They place the most implicit
faith in the British, and are quite persuaded in their own
minds that our Government will never stand by and see them
seriously pushed by the Abyssinians without giving them, at
any rate, moral help of some sort. They turn to us as their
natural protectors, as they would have turned to the Egyptians
had that Government continued to hold the coast.</p>

<p>As related in the last chapter, we received the first news of
Abyssinian interference with the Jibril Abokr when surveying
in June ’91. A chief named Banagúsé had demanded tribute
in cattle, and had also sent out marauding parties from Jig-Jiga,
the fortified post which had been pushed out by the
Abyssinians into the Marar Prairie, to lift cattle from the
Jibril Abokr. This tribe, which is really a sub-tribe of the
Habr Awal, who are under British protection, appealed to us
for help from Aden, at a meeting of the elders held by me at
Ujawáji, June ’91, in front of my tent. The elders there told
us that the principal authors of the trouble were Banagúsé and
Basha-Basha, two Abyssinian generals, the former being the
responsible person at Jig-Jiga and the latter in western Ogádén.</p>

<p>It appears that these two chiefs had been using the Bertiri
tribe, who live in the Harar Highlands, as a “cat’s paw” in
making requisitions for cattle on the Habr Awal and Ogádén
tribes. The tribute of cattle was always collected at Jig-Jiga
and then sent up in a great mob to Harar, where the people
were reported to be starving, and where the large number of
Abyssinian soldiers occupying the place required to be rationed.</p>

<p>The fortified post of Jig-Jiga was also a constant menace
to the large village of Hargeisa, within the British Protectorate,
and the elders said that every year the trouble between the
outlying Abyssinian chiefs and the nomad Somáli tribes near
the coast would increase, unless something could be done to
make the former cease their buccaneering raids.</p>

<p>The substance of the statement made by the spokesman at
the meeting in my camp was as follows:—</p>

<p>“The Bertiri come from Jig-Jiga armed with rifles and
demand tribute of cattle from us, and in certain cases have
looted our live stock when out grazing. We cannot make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
reprisals on the Bertiri, as they are protected by the Abyssinians.
Ordinary feuds with our neighbours we think fair-play, but
these Bertiri raids are a losing business for us all round. We
are not allowed to import firearms, the only effective weapons
against the Abyssinians; and we ask the British, who have
occupied our ports, either to protect us, or to allow us to import
guns with which we can protect ourselves.”</p>

<p>Owing, I believe, to action from Aden, the trouble was
stopped, to the lasting satisfaction of the tribes on the northern
side.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> On the east, however, in Ogádén, the Abyssinians
became more active than ever; and on another journey, in
1890, this time through Milmil, we again had to listen to
complaints against them.</p>

<p>We arrived at Berbera for the Milmil trip, which was the
first exploration of the eastern Abyssinian border by Europeans,
on 1st July 1892. The <i>Haga</i> wind was at its height, and as
nothing could be done during the first half of each day, owing
to the storms, it was fully a week before we got our caravan
under way.</p>

<p>The day before we left Berbera an enormous column of
black smoke, which we estimated to be over two thousand feet
high, was seen to rise from the sea-level in the west, over the site
of Bulhár, forty miles away. Soon the news arrived that Bulhár
had been burnt to the ground. This has always been an
unlucky place. It has been burnt three times since the British
occupation, and in 1892 was depopulated by cholera; and
three years before that it was raided by the Esa in a dust-storm,
and sixty-seven of the people killed.</p>

<p>We marched by easy stages to Hargeisa, by following the
Aleyadéra nala, the home of the beautiful lesser koodoo, of which
I managed to bag a couple of bucks the day before we reached
Hargeisa, which we entered on 17th July, and found deserted.
Sheikh Mattar had gone to Haraf, four miles up the river,
according to his custom at the <i>Haga</i> season, because of the
better pasture there; he, however, came with a lot of religious
mullahs to meet us, and was very pleasant, giving us letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of introduction to the chiefs of the Rer Ali and Abbasgúl,
Ogádén tribes to whose country we were bound.</p>

<p>For the first time we had to face the crossing of the waterless
Haud plateau, there being a hundred miles between
Hargeisa and Milmil without a drop of water. To accomplish
this we took up two hundred and fifty gallons in the <i>háns</i> of
plaited bark which we had brought for the purpose.</p>

<p>This was the first time my brother and I had had an opportunity
of crossing the Haud plateau, which is here some five
thousand feet above sea-level. I have traversed it many times
since, and the description of this our first crossing will give an
idea of the peculiar nature of the country. I will not give an
account of our daily sport, but I may mention that in feeding
our thirty men we shot many oryx or Sœmmering’s gazelles
in the bush country, and hartebeests when crossing the open <i>ban</i>.</p>

<p>On the 20th of July we marched up to the level of the
plateau behind Hargeisa village, over thorn-covered rolling
ground, the soil being red earth. We did eleven miles and
halted at Bombós, in a splendidly grassed hollow, just beyond
some Habr Awal karias. Hearing from the karia people that
there had been rain at Garabíss, near here, at about 9 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>
we sent a camel with four <i>háns</i>, and the men returned with the
water at 1 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span></p>

<p>The next day we made a morning march of twelve miles
to Dobóya, over rolling ground, which is stony on the elevations
and has good grass in the depressions, the whole country being
covered with flat-topped thorn jungle about twenty feet high.
Near our midday camp some Midgáns were skinning an oryx
which had been killed by a lion the night before, and at Garabíss
we crossed the tracks of a number of Eidegalla horsemen, who
had come north to loot the karias which we had passed through
the day before.</p>

<p>In the evening march, after going a little over five miles, we
came to the end of the thorn-trees, and emerged on to a great
open plain of short grass called Ban-ki-Aror, about five miles
across, and stretching far away to the east and west, without a
bush. Our caravan travelled through abundance of game, chiefly
oryx, hartebeests, and Sœmmering’s gazelles, which followed our
steps while we were in the <i>ban</i>. The sight of these open grass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
plains covered with wild animal life was always a source of the
greatest pleasure to me.</p>

<p>Our caravan had now swelled to a long procession, as a
number of people had come with us from the last karias to
take advantage of our protection past the Eidegalla country.</p>

<p class="caption">Game on the Plains</p>
</div>

<p>We camped on the farther side of this great plain, near
some Samanter Abdalla karias. Here we heard that a lion
roared nightly round them, and next evening, at Gudaweina, we
saw his pugs in the path. Thus we had found lion, ostrich, oryx,
hartebeest, and Sœmmering’s gazelle, all living at least forty
miles from water. The effect of thirst on our domestic animals
was to make them abnormally tame. Often as I lay in my tent at
the noon camp the donkeys and ponies would force their heads
within the tent door, and the goats would walk straight in, putting
their muzzles into every cup to look for water. As we arrived
at one halting-place at dusk, a wild fox came trotting like a dog
behind the caravan, a few yards from the last camel, having
smelt the water which we carried in the <i>háns</i> on the camels’
backs.</p>

<p>Travelling constantly over rolling, densely-wooded country,
we were now entering the part of the Haud which is grazed over
by the Ogádén from the south, and struck the Warda-Gumaréd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
one of the great trade arteries between Berbera and the Webbe
Shabéleh. The track here, for thirty miles at least, over red
powdery earth, is so well worn and smooth that a bicycle might
easily be ridden at full speed on it. On either side of the path
all was thorn forest and grassy glades. The grasses were chiefly
the <i>darémo</i>, growing in tufts to about a foot, and <i>durr</i>, growing
to six feet, both very fattening for live stock. The umbrella
mimósa, called <i>khansa</i>, grows to a height of ten feet, the bushes
spreading out till their tops meet, forming shady tunnels which
are the favourite haunt of lions and leopards during the heat of
the day. They come out at night into the great plains and
feed on the herds of game which live in the open. Sometimes,
when gorged and lazy, the lions are caught in the early morning
returning over the plains, and are ridden to a standstill
by the Somális, and killed with poisoned arrows and spears.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Dik-Dik Antelope</span> (<i>Sakdro gussuli</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>After passing Garodki Mayagód, an ancient clearing in the
thorn forest, we came to the usual caravan halting-place, a
zeríba of thorns, occupied occasionally by the nomads or by
caravans as they pass along the road. At the side of the track
were shallow depressions in the soil where rain-water had rested,
and round these dry pools were rows of small pits six inches deep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
dug by Somális in order to stand up the water <i>háns</i> to be
filled.</p>

<p>The jungle now began to get more open and the glades
wider, the <i>durr</i> grass growing in beautiful feathery clumps.
Huge red ant-hills appeared at every hundred yards or so, often
twelve feet thick at the base, and with a pinnacle twenty-five
feet high, looking like a giant hand and beckoning forefinger.</p>

<p class="caption">Buck Gerenúk feeding</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Waller’s Gazelle.</span></p>
</div>

<p>On the evening of the third day we got on to high ground
almost imperceptibly, and camped at the southern side of an
old fire clearing near Gudaweina. Looking back we could see,
in the clear air of the elevated Haud, beyond the tops of the
nearer thorn-trees, the various gradations of tint—yellow, brown,
green, or blue—on the several bits of jungle or grass glades
which we had come through; and beyond all a high rim of
deep indigo blue, looking like a sea-horizon, running without a
single landmark, showing the great expanse of the Haud forest
stretching in every direction in everlasting dips and rises of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
ground. All the hills about Hargeisa had long ago sunk out
of sight.</p>

<p>On the fourth day we marched on to Kheidub-Ayéyu. For
a mile we went slowly in the dawning light through thorny
jungle, and then we came out into a glade of <i>durr</i> grass, the
camels swinging along faster as the path became more visible.
We passed a chief’s grave, encircled by a stockade of trunks
of thorn-trees twelve feet high.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> We afterwards emerged on to
open rising ground, where we saw oryx and Waller’s gazelles
feeding, and in the centre of the path a wart-hog had been
rooting up the ground.</p>

<p>The open pasture here was dotted with the old zeríbas of
the Samanter Abdalla, Habr Awal, who come from the north
for a season every year. They were here six weeks before us,
but the rain falling, they had returned to Aror, where we had
seen them a few days previously when crossing the open <i>ban</i>.
These were also the most northern pastures of the Ogádén
tribes, none of which we had ever visited, and we were doubtful
as to the nature of our reception.</p>

<p>We entered a patch of bush, when suddenly the jungle became
alive with camels and sheep, and several young women
rushed at the caravan with their hands spread out and eyes
flashing, screaming loudly for help, while others plied sticks and
stones to drive off the flocks, in a deafening clamour and clouds
of dust; and boys ran off in haste to summon the fighting men
of the tribe.</p>

<p>I sat down in the path, trying to look as amiable as
possible, for I realised what our sudden appearance must have
been to these natives. Several of my men, more ready, raced
forward and caught the flying messengers, and brought them
back to me as prisoners. The women were sure we were
Abyssinians, for we carried guns; but finding we were English,
a revulsion of feeling set in, and the boys went off to tell the
tribe the joyful news, and the women to get milk for our men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The mounted guard soon galloped up to us, a sturdy-looking
lot, some twenty of the Rer Ali tribe; they expressed their
delight by circling their horses, shouting, “<i>Mót! Mót! io Mót!</i>”
and coming up again and again, bending down in the saddle to
shake hands with us; and their steaming ponies formed a dense
circle round us as we endeavoured to do justice to the hands.</p>

<p>The people asked us to stop for a few hours to shoot
rhinoceroses, but of course we were unable to spare the time,
as we were carrying on a rapid survey, and also had too little
water to be able to loiter here in the centre of the Haud. We
passed enormous flocks of fat sheep, and near camp we met
a pretty young woman driving along her dowry of a hundred
camels. Our men said this Rer Ali wealth was good to look
at, and that a few determined horsemen armed with guns could
have taken off ten thousand camels at one swoop.</p>

<p>While camped at Kheidub-Ayéyu we observed a long strip
of jungle-fire creeping along the ridge of thorn forest in our
front. Clouds of smoke were floating far ahead of the fire, and
it must have been driven by a strong south-west gale, judging
by the pace. The Habr Gerhajis and two sub-tribes of the
Habr Awal had at different times taken advantage of this
solitary occupation by trying to loot the karias, but were always
driven off. Although living in only two, there were a large
number of fighting men in proportion to the women and children
in this clan; and they were some of the best mounted of the
Rer Ali, always a warlike tribe. The chief of the clan was
called Mahomed Liba.</p>

<p>We marched through patches of burnt jungle, with the trees
still smouldering, and pits left in the ground full of white ashes,
where the roots had been burnt out.</p>

<p>Near Yoaleh we came to stony ground, the first since leaving
Aror. On 25th July we left the Haud and descended into
the valley of the Tug Milmil, a sandy nala wooded with <i>gób</i><a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
trees about eighty feet high, fringing the river-bed and growing
on islands in the centre of the expanse of sand, some seventy
yards wide at this point. We found ponies, sheep, and camels
of the Rer Harún and Rer Ali, Ogádén, watering at Milmil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
wells. One continuous stream of camels marched up and down
the river-bed, and we must have seen some twenty thousand in all.</p>

<p>There had been a quarrel just before our arrival between
the Rer Harún here and Mahomed Liba’s clan which we had
met at Kheidub-Ayéyu, in which two men had been killed and
two hundred camels had changed owners.</p>

<p>On the day of our arrival at Milmil, at the end of the Haud
crossing of one hundred and five miles, I had still seven full
<i>háns</i> in my portion of the caravan, nine having been expended,
say forty gallons of water for fifteen men for five days. About
fifteen gallons of this had been spilt from various causes, so that
fifteen men, one Arab fast camel, and two goats drank only
twenty-seven gallons, or a little over five gallons a day, including
cooking water. I attribute this moderation partly to the coolness
of the weather in the elevated Haud. We had crossed in five
days, thus doing twenty-one miles a day; this fact will indicate
the good state of the caravan track over the red stoneless soil.
Indeed, as I have stated before, a bicycle might have been
ridden at speed over nine-tenths of the distance.</p>

<p>The Haud ends at Milmil in a succession of bluffs a hundred
feet high, and as one descends between them to the Milmil
nala, one emerges on to the general level of Ogádén, and farther
on at the wells the country opens up, disclosing several hills;
two of these, called Firk-Firk, resemble the remarkable twin
hills at Hargeisa which are called “Náso Hablod,” or the
“Maiden’s Breasts.”</p>

<p>Soon after we had pitched camp at the part of Milmil which
is called Gagáb an important travelling sheikh arrived. The
Somáli so-called sheikh is a religious mullah who has gained a
great and wide-spread reputation for piety, and being intelligent,
even among mullahs, can often read and write Arabic, although
he is generally as black or brown in skin as any other Somáli.</p>

<p>The horsemen of the Rer Ali came down in scores, attired
in all their finery of red-tasselled saddlery and red and blue
<i>khaili</i> tobes, to go through the usual <i>dibáltig</i> before the great
man, whose name is Au Mahomed Sufi. They formed a large
crowd on the sand of the river-bed below our tent, which was
pitched under some large trees overhanging the Milmil nala.
The sheikh’s own bivouac was on the same bank of the river<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>,
about five hundred yards to the north of us. I joined the
crowd of onlookers with my brother, and Au Mahomed Sufi,
the recipient of the honours of the day, came forward and shook
hands with us, and gave us a place by his side.</p>

<p>This man was travelling through Ogádén, and was, I afterwards
learnt, part of an organised plot for rousing the Somáli
tribes to combine against the Abyssinians. After the <i>dibáltig</i>
he lifted his spear and addressed the assembled people, beginning
by himself singing what appeared to be a composition of his own.</p>

<p>In the evening, taking my hunters, I followed the tracks of a
lion which had stolen a sheep from the Rer Ali flocks in broad
daylight. Getting into broken country at the base of one of the
bluffs, we put up two lions. We could not see them, although
we heard them roar significantly, as though they had seen us.
We found their lair, and part of the carcase of the sheep, close
by, and within a yard of it was a dead vulture, which the lions
had just killed, no doubt, by springing out of the ambush from
which they had kept watch over the meat. Several vultures
were perched on the branches of the trees around, looking wistfully
down, but not daring to come to the feast. The lions
eventually got on to stony ground and we lost them.</p>

<p>Next day a large number of horsemen came to welcome us
at our own camp, and said they had come to <i>dibáltig</i> to us as
representatives of the English Government. We appointed
midday for this ceremony.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I went after a lion, climbing one of the bluffs,
which are two or three hundred feet high; and after hunting
through thick high grass for some time, I sat down to rest
below the edge of a bluff. While my men were wandering
about, the lion got up with a low grunt, a few yards above the
rock on which I sat, and made off into the grass. Following,
I found his lair, and the half-eaten carcase of a young camel,
about as large as a donkey, which the lion had dragged to the
top of the hill, afterwards going to sleep by its side. It was
within a few yards of the sleeping lion that I had been
unconsciously sitting for ten minutes. He went down the
stony, bush-covered hill, and eventually escaped us.</p>

<p>It was during the early part of the afternoon that some
five hundred horse and foot came to our camp for the promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
ceremonies. Au Mahomed Sufi attended, and we gave him a
place beside us. On a signal being given, the horsemen drew
up in line in front of us, and the chief tribal minstrel of the
Rer Ali, while sitting in the saddle, sang a refrain in honour of
the English, and of myself and my brother, who had “deigned
to visit their poor oppressed country.” A splendid array they
made, well mounted and warlike, the biceps standing out on
some of the men’s arms in a way that is seldom seen on these
sparely-built Somális.</p>

<p>On the conclusion of the song the horsemen gave a series
of shrill yells, and with arms and legs flying, they started off at
full gallop in pursuit of an imaginary enemy up the river-bed;
and the pounding of the hoofs could be heard long after they
had been lost to sight in clouds of red dust. Presently they
came back again, the glinting of the sun on their spears being
first fitfully seen in the pall of dust; and darting up furiously,
they brought their ponies on to their haunches with the cruel
bit, forming a dense semicircle of horses’ heads within a foot
of me, the riders crying, “<i>Mót!</i>” and being answered by “<i>Kul
leban</i>” and a hand-shake.</p>

<p>Au Mahomed Sufi began a long speech, which was heard
in dead silence by the crowd, saying that now the white men
had come it was time to attack the Abyssinians, and that if we
would lead them with our thirty rifles, they could soon collect
a large force and march on the Abyssinian chief, Basha-Basha.</p>

<p>We interrupted him, broke up the meeting, and retired to
our tents, saying we had come to survey caravan routes and
not to be mixed up in their quarrels.</p>

<p>In the evening we gave a performance in return, parading
the thirty camp-followers in line, armed with their Snider
carbines, advancing and retiring in skirmishing order, and
forming rallying groups; and we fired off blank cartridge, each
volley being echoed by an answering yell from the delighted
tribesmen.</p>

<p>They said that now the English, their masters, had come,
the Abyssinians would leave off raiding their camels and
carrying off their women. Many of the chiefs came to our
tents begging for written testimonials, saying that they were
sure a scrap of paper written on by an Englishman was enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
alone to keep back an Abyssinian army. The women and
children hung round my camel and my brother’s pony in
crowds, crying out, “Now it’s all right; the English have come.”</p>

<p>Then came the question of presents. The people had
brought us a few sheep and a donkey, and long rows of their
milk-vessels, which are prettily decorated with white shells.
We picked out an <i>ákil</i> to whom Sheikh Mattar of Hargeisa
had given us a letter of introduction; then we put into his
hands several white tobes and two <i>khaili</i> tobes, and asked him
to settle with the chiefs of clans. There arose a tremendous
clamour, each clan having sent an advocate to represent it in
the scramble for tobes, which occurred in the river-bed below.
An indescribable uproar continued until nightfall, the clamouring
“wise men” squatting on the ground in circles, looking for all
the world like vultures with their skinny necks and shaven
skulls, clawing with lean fingers at the presents spread out on
the sand. There was a scuffle down at the wells, across the
river, where two men had retired to settle an old feud. After
throwing their spears, they closed and stabbed at each other,
the spears striking the shields with a hollow thud, which we
could hear from our tents three hundred yards away; but
they were subsequently parted by a posse of relations.</p>

<p>One of the things which pleased the Rer Ali most was my
Arab pony, which I had taken from Abdul Kader’s stables in
Bombay to test the Somáli climate. My brother mounted him
and tried a friendly gallop with one or two of the tribesmen in
succession, and he proved, to their great wonder, faster than
any pony which the Rer Ali could bring against him. He
afterwards beat many Somáli ponies all over the country, and
gained a great reputation, although I had only bought him as
a useful animal up to weight, and he would be considered
quite slow among Arab ponies of his height, which was about
13.3. I have often since been identified by Somális as the
owner of “that Hindi pony which could gallop like the wind.”</p>

<p>By nightfall we were glad that the long dusty day of
ceremony was over, and next morning, when a number of Rer
Harún horsemen arrived and asked to be allowed to repeat the
show, we found ourselves obliged to decline the honour, and
continued our survey westward towards the Abyssinian border.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Our men, on the night of the Rer Ali <i>dibáltig</i>, went to the
karias and danced till nearly daylight, the women clapping
their hands and jumping up and down, keeping up a monotonous
refrain. Next day half our men were ill, having gorged
themselves upon the mutton and camel meat which had been
generously provided by the Rer Ali.</p>

<p>We passed the deserted village of Dagahbúr and reached a
rounded grassy hill called Túli, and it was while encamped here
that we shot the first Somáli rhinoceros, an animal which for
many years we had expected to come upon, but which up till
then had never been seen or shot by an European. We found
plenty of game at Túli, and as I rode up to the rounded hill to
choose a site for my camp, a troop of ostriches went racing
away into the sea of bush and grass to the north-west.</p>

<p>To the west of Gumbur Túli lay a valley covered with
dense dark mimósa forest, called Dih Wiyileh,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> or Rhinoceros
Valley. Between Dagahbúr and Waror, an interval of fifty
miles, the country was waterless at this season, and hearing
that Waror was occupied by Abyssinian soldiers, I deemed it
advisable to arrive there with a supply of water on the camels;
so finding the <i>háns</i> rather low, I had to wait at Túli a couple
of days while we sent back to Dagahbúr for more water.</p>

<p>The time had come when I hoped to make the acquaintance
of the long-sought rhinoceroses; and I left camp in the early
morning with my two gunbearers Géli and Hassan, and another
man called Au Ismail, who led our one camel and acted as
guide.</p>

<p>Taking a line to the south-west across the Dih Wiyileh
from Túli Hill, we presently came on fresh rhinoceros signs.
These we took up till nearly midday, the two beasts we were
following having made a maze of tracks there while feeding
in the morning. At last Géli pointed to our game—two
rhinoceroses standing, apparently asleep, under a shady thorn
bush. I advanced to forty yards, and opened fire with the four-bore,
putting a four-ounce bullet into the shoulder of each with
a right and left, making them tear away at a gallop through
the jungle. I followed at best pace, putting in two more
cartridges as I ran, and so finishing one of the rhinos. Passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
this one, I found the other standing in thick bush broadside on,
listening and looking for its fellow. Feeling for cartridges, I
put my hand into empty pockets, the rest having fallen out in
my haste, so I ran back to the camel to snatch more out of a
haversack. Au Ismail saw me running back away from the
rhinoceros, and jumped to the conclusion that I was running
away! So he began to bolt with the camel. I ran harder
and harder, shouting to him to stop, and at last I got hold of
him and explained what I wanted. Then, rearmed, I returned
to the rhinoceros, which had been standing meanwhile in the
same place, apparently unable to make out what I was about,
and too sick to charge. Another shot finished it. Unfortunately
they were both cows, but I was very pleased at the result
of my first rhino hunt.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;" id="illus19">
<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="460" height="180" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A trial of strength</p>
</div>

<p>I returned with the two heads to camp, and sent half a
dozen men to cut off the shields, of which we obtained thirty-five
from the two skins. These men arrived in camp next
morning, and said that while they had been cutting up the
rhinos by the light of torches, several more had come round
them, and a lion had roared to the westward.</p>

<p>On our second day at Túli we were unsuccessful with the
rhinos, and when the water came from Dagahbúr we marched
to Gumbur Wedel, a small hill four miles to the north-west
across the Rhinoceros Valley. Here we found oryx, ostriches,
and Sœmmering’s and Waller’s gazelles very plentiful, and
rhino tracks numerous. My brother was very keen to get a
rhino, but had so far had no luck.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> on 6th August we left Wedel, and for three miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
struggled through thick grass and jungle, and then struck a
good path running north-west. After going a mile along this
I saw fresh rhino tracks where a pair had crossed the path
during the night, and so going on with the caravan, I left my
brother to take up the pursuit. At our evening camp he
arrived with the heads of both, a very fine bull and a cow, and
we skinned them by firelight.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 7th August the caravan marched
sixteen miles to a karia of the Rer Gedi, Abbasgúl, to us a
new sub-tribe, at a place called Haddáma. Early in the day,
while walking along the path, I came on the fresh tracks of a
large bull rhino, so, as it was my turn, leaving the caravan and
traversing work in charge of my brother, I left the path on
these tracks, followed by Géli and Hassan. The rhinoceros
had taken a straight line for a ridge of low hills to the south,
which are a continuation of the Harar Highlands, and after
following for several miles through thick jungle and over burnt
clearings, the sun getting hotter and hotter, we at last put him
up at about noon, making him rush off through the forest without
our even getting a sight of him. I took up the tracking
patiently for an hour more, and then we heard the trampling
and snorting and smashing of thorn-trees again. Following at
a run, we saw him standing broadside on, listening, in the
centre of several acres of very transparent but dense and thorny
wait-a-bit cover. We at once lay down. Not hearing our
footsteps any more, the rhino trotted forward, head held high,
for fifty yards, and then stood and listened again. He looked
decidedly vicious. We crawled up to a small evergreen shrub,
and I sat up behind it, and taking a steady rest upon my knees,
fired for his ear at a range of seventy yards with my ten-bore
rifle.</p>

<p>The bull dropped in his tracks, an inert mass. Going up,
we found that the ten-bore had hit him exactly where I had
aimed, the bullet entering under the left ear and stopping
under the skin of the right temple.</p>

<p>I was twenty-five miles from camp, and as the camel was
fully occupied in carrying the massive head and a few shields,
I had to tramp the whole way. This, added to the hot tracking
work of five hours before we got the rhino, and the fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
run after putting him up, made a long day’s work, and I was
right glad at sunset to meet some men whom my brother had
considerately sent back with water and dates to bring us on
to my half of the caravan, which he had halted for me at
Haddáma. He had himself gone on to Waror, for we never
allowed shooting to delay the rate of progress, and I came up
with him there next morning; as usual, we reformed the
double camp, with our “Cabul” tents side by side. The camp
was pitched near the wells in a beautiful glade, covered with
green grass, kept short by the Abbasgúl herds. We found an
immense number of cows watering here, the chief wealth of
the Abbasgúl being in cattle. The wells at Waror are narrow,
circular funnels seventy feet deep, sunk through the red alluvial
earth of the Jerer Valley. Steps were cut all the way down,
and water was passed to the surface by a chain of nine naked
men, standing one above the other, their feet resting on these
steps, the full and empty leather buckets being passed up and
down from hand to hand to an accompaniment of singing in
chorus.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> We showed the Abbasgúl how to do it with a large
bucket and a long rope, whereat they were greatly pleased.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;" id="illus20">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="460" height="180" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The Waror pasture, with its closely-cropped grass, under
open thorn jungle, looked like an English orchard; and the
wind blowing coldly with a leaden sky, heightened the resemblance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
There was plenty of game about here. Round the
base of a small rock called Dubbur, perched on the top of some
high ground five miles from Waror, oryx and ostriches abound.
At one place, near Waror, my brother found the ground pounded
up, where some Midgáns’ dogs had brought an oryx to bay,
and in the grass the blood of the animal and a broken arrow;
close by were the pugs of a lion. A lion roared at night while
we were at Waror. The people said one was in the habit of
showing himself about once a day in broad daylight, and that
he had killed twelve men, the last of whom fell a victim the
day before we halted at the wells.</p>

<p>The Abbasgúl headmen came to us and gave us quantities
of milk, calling us their protectors. They said that their tribe
was once rich, but was now poor, because of the Abyssinians.
They were unfortunate in being next to the east of the Bertiri,
whom the Abyssinians had already absorbed.</p>

<p>The only Somáli tribes which may be said to be under
Abyssinian influence are the Géri, Bertiri, Abbasgúl, a few of
the Esa, and Malingúr. But they are all unwillingly so, and
have at various times clamoured for help from the British.
They all trade with Berbera.</p>

<p>The Rer Amáden and the riverine negro population of the
Webbe are well disposed to the British, though not much
connected with Berbera except to the east in the Shabéleh
district, whence a large proportion of Berbera caravans are
derived.</p>

<p>These headmen said that the Abyssinians every now and
then came from Jig-Jiga with rifles, and did what pleased them
best; that they killed Abbasgúl sheep and cattle for food,
entered the karias and used the huts; that they forced even
the old chiefs to hew wood and draw water, and interfered with
the women; and that many Abbasgúl who had tried to defend
their homes had been shot down.</p>

<p>This tribe seemed utterly cowed, and quite unlike the warlike
and independent people whom we had met at Milmil. I
noticed very few horses, and the tribesmen said that all their
best had been taken by the Abyssinians.</p>

<p>The Abbasgúl told us that, three years before our trip, the
Abyssinians came from Harar and overran all this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
even as far as the Sheikh Ash and Rer Ali tribes; and going
into the Rer Harún country beyond Milmil, they came back
by way of the Rer Amáden and Adan Khair to the far south,
to Imé; here they were among the Gállas and the Adone, or
riverine negro population of the Webbe Shabéleh. The
Abyssinians are said to have got by threats or violence a
tribute of camels, cattle, or sheep from every tribe passed
through on this far-reaching raid. We were beginning to get
very curious about these Abyssinians, whom neither of us had
ever met in all our wanderings.</p>

<p>One of our men stupidly told a crowd of people at the
wells that we had come to attack Banagúsé, the commander of
the Jig-Jiga outpost, and it was not till we heard shouts of
delight from the men, women, and children collected, that we
discovered this foolishness, and put a stop to it.</p>

<p>An Abbasgúl <i>ákil</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> to whom Sheikh Mattar had given us
an Arabic letter, came to our camp. He said the Abyssinians
were at Jig-Jiga, about thirty miles in our front, and that there
were quite a hundred soldiers and a disorderly mob of Harar
people there. So, as the object of our journey was the
construction of a route map, without coming to blows with
any one, we decided to defer our visit till a more fitting
opportunity.</p>

<p>So far we had done three hundred miles of route in twenty-nine
days, or ten and a half miles a day including halts, all of
the road having been carefully traversed with prismatic compass,
the main points being fixed by observations of the stars with
a transit theodolite. We had travelled sixty-four miles without
water between Dagahbúr and Waror, so that between Hargeisa
and the latter place we had gone over two hundred miles of
unexplored route with only two intermediate watering-places;
yet all this country had been very fertile and subject to a considerable
rainfall. With a proper system of tanks, involving, of
course, a great initial outlay, combined with a steady, cultivating
population, instead of the lazy, strife-loving Somáli nomads
who now own the soil, much of this tract could, I believe, be
made to rival some of the best parts of India. People who
visit only the arid sandy Maritime Plain of the low coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
country near Berbera, or see it from ships, can get little idea
of the fine soil, good rainfall, and cool, healthy climate of these
interior plateaux.</p>

<p>About the middle of August we broke up our Waror camp
and marched to Abonsa, in the Harar Highlands, the elevation
being six thousand feet, whence a fine view was obtained over
the distant Marar Prairie to the north. On the way, at Koran,
we passed six men carrying Remington rifles, three of whom
were Abyssinians, the first we had seen. They were very civil
and shook hands. Our guide said this was a party going to
Gerlogubi, in Central Ogádén, to get “tribute.”</p>

<p>We had now gone as near to Jig-Jiga as we dared, and we
proposed to return to Hargeisa to pick up some stores which
we had left with Sheikh Mattar, and to make a fresh start for
the Harar border on the Gildessa side, hoping to be able to
include Jig-Jiga in the map if it should turn out to have been
vacated by the Abyssinians.</p>

<p>The whole of the country south of Waror and Abonsa was
much disturbed by a feud between the Ahmed Abdalla, Habr
Awal, and the Rer Farah, Abbasgúl. We divided our camps
at Dubbur in order to survey more ground, and my brother, in
returning to Hargeisa across the Marar Prairie, passed through
the fighting tribes, and saw many of their mounted scouts, who
were uniformly civil to him. Meanwhile I struck across the
Haud bush, forty miles to the east of my brother’s route.</p>

<p>While I was encamped on 16th August among the Ahmed
Abdalla karias at Karígri, in open jungle, a surprise was
attempted on them by the Rer Farah, Abbasgúl. A hue and cry
was raised, and the plain was soon swarming with men, who came
out of the karias with spears and shields to repulse the attack.
The enemy upon seeing this retired. The affair was so sudden
that the Gerád or Sultán of the Ahmed Abdalla was with his
headmen drinking coffee in my camp at the time. On the
first news their horses were brought up ready saddled from the
karias, and they mounted without delay and rode to the south,
disappearing in the clouds of red dust raised by the flocks and
herds which were being driven in by the women.</p>

<p>We again met and formed the double camp over the wells
at Hargeisa, and during the few days we were there we had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
pleasant company; for two sportsmen’s caravans—those of Col.
R. Curteis of Poona, and of Captain Harrison, 8th King’s—passed
through Hargeisa on their way to the Haud hunting-grounds.</p>

<p>The first fifty miles from Hargeisa being perfectly safe
country, we made our fresh start on 24th August in two half
caravans, and as the climate during this part of our wanderings
was somewhat peculiar, showing that the Haud and Marar
Prairie share in the great rainfall of the high Abyssinian
plateau, I will give a short account of the first portion of the
journey, the facts being taken from our Diary.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>24th August.</i>—We had only gone three miles when a deluge
of rain came on, and having taken refuge under some very thin
bushes for half an hour, we were drenched through. The storm
showing no signs of abating we went on again, splashing
through water up to our ankles; and so on for another mile,
till we came to the banks of a small watercourse, down which
rushed a yellow torrent which we tried to cross, but were
obliged to beat a retreat; one camel rolled over and over, and
the bags of rice were scattered along the bed of the stream,
and fished out by the men going breast-deep. So we looked
out for a little sandy rise, and camped under pelting rain,
which continued till 7 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> next day. By 10.30, having waited
for the stream to become passable and for our kit to dry, we
were able to march, reaching Dofaré at 3.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> The karias
of the Rer Samanter were found all along the way from Haraf,
and we met hundreds of cows and thousands of camels. It
rained all night long; and another storm, with thunder and
lightning, came on at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> next morning, just as things were
beginning to get dry.</p>

<p><i>26th August.</i>—We started off in pouring rain at 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>
It rained more or less the whole day, and everything was
soaked. My brother went on ahead with his half of the caravan
towards Dubburro, but the caravan twice lost him and the
guide, and he was on foot from 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> till 4.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> in a deluge
of rain. Luckily we had before surveyed this ground. At
last he gave up trying to find the tracks of his caravan, and
walked to Dubburro, where he found it halted, after a march
of twenty-five miles under continuous rain. I had halted some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
miles in rear of him, but had not the least notion where I was.
The whole country seemed flooded.</p>

<p><i>27th August.</i>—My brother arrived at 7.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> at my
camp, his own having gone on. He had lost his caravan, so I
lent him my pony, and he at last reached his men, after having
gone thirty miles, all but the last two miles being on foot, in
rain-soaked boots, with violent toothache added to his other
miseries. The last hour was in the dark, but he was kept from
falling asleep at the roadside by the roaring of a lion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Élinta Kaddo</span>, <i>28th August</i>.—It rained during the night.
We had a few days of pleasanter weather after this, but it
rained, more or less, daily during the whole of this trip till we
reached Gildessa.</p>

<p>We marched across the beautiful Marar Prairie, to Gumbur
Dúg, halting at several of the high conical hills which rise out
of the elevated plain to nearly seven thousand feet above sea-level,
as we wished to get a base from which to triangulate in
points of the Harar Highlands which we were not able to visit.</p>

<p>We reached Gumbur Dúg on the morning of 1st September.
Gumbur Dúg is a low, grass-covered hill of white limestone.
Jig-Jiga was now close to us. Next morning vast herds of
hartebeests were seen on the plain, comprising several thousands;
and when we shot one, the plain was covered with a line of
swiftly galloping animals, a mile or two in length, half obscured
in clouds of red dust and flying turf.</p>

<p>To the south was a karia of the Bertiri tribe, and we sent
two scouts on in the evening to find out whether Jig-Jiga was
still occupied by the Abyssinians. These men returned late at
night, reporting the karia deserted, but that they had found
men tending camels. The Bertiri karias were all at Jig-Jiga,
and the Abyssinians were encamped some miles off in the
Gureis Hills, coming to Jig-Jiga every morning to water cattle
and horses, and returning to their villages at night. The scouts
reported that they met some Midgáns near the water, and that
these men ran at them and would have attacked them, but were
afraid of the two rifles. It afterwards transpired that my men
had been telling a lie; they had really met a large crowd of
Bertiri, who had run at them, thinking they were robbers; and
my two scouts, in their fright, had fired a round of buckshot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
into their faces. They afterwards confessed to having knocked
down a woman with a pellet in the lip. On my instituting an
inquiry among the Bertiri next day, the elders said, “It is so,
and she is dead; she is only a Midgán woman, and has no
relations, so it doesn’t matter.” Asking them to show me the
grave, they said it didn’t matter, and that the Abyssinians
would have killed fifty instead of one, and that the English
were good people! Failing to get any sensible answers to my
questions, I explained the heinous nature of the offence, and
advised them to complain at the Resident’s Court at Berbera.
But no complaint was ever made, so I think that though a
woman was really knocked down by a spent pellet, she was not
killed; and the elders reported her death in the hope of a
present.</p>

</div>

<p>On 2nd September we marched over some rolling and open
<i>ban</i> to the Jig-Jiga Valley, and camped at the water within
three hundred yards of the ill-famed Abyssinian stockaded fort,
which had been such a thorn in the side of the Jibril Abokr
tribe. We found it untenanted; and as the Bertiri made no
objection, we went over it and took some photographs.</p>

<p>The Jig-Jiga post is a work pushed out by the Abyssinians
into the Bertiri part of the Marar Prairie, and it commands the
route from Berbera to Harar. It is a strong redoubt surmounted
by a rough stockade, the thin tops of the interlaced
branches being about thirteen feet from the ground outside.
The earthwork is a banquette four or five yards wide, rising in
two steps to seven feet above the ground. The banquette and
stockade are continuous round the enclosed space, which is a
circle of about one hundred yards in diameter. It is strong
enough against attacks by spearmen, but would give imperfect
cover against musketry fire. On the outside the small branches
of the stockade are bent outwards to form very flimsy <i>chevaux
de frise</i>. There is one doorway, with a platform above on which
a sentry can stand. Inside the enclosure were some very good
circular huts, with perpendicular sides and conical thatched roofs.</p>

<p>A small watercourse, about eight feet deep, which would
give cover for men running along the bottom, goes half-way
round the stockade on the east side, at about fifty yards’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
distance, so that men could collect there at night, and with the
help of straw and kerosene oil the place might be burnt down
and the inmates stabbed while trying to put out the fire. The
work stands on the southern side of the Jig-Jiga Valley within
three hundred yards of the usual wells, the Jig-Jiga Valley
here being merely a depression in the open grass plains of the
Marar Prairie.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian garrison varies in strength; sometimes the
work is left deserted, as on the occasion of our visit, when the
garrison had gone to the Harrawa Valley for a few days, leaving
the wells to the Bertiri and their cattle.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>We were glad to have hit off our visit to this post so
fortunately, and without having come into collision with the
Abyssinians. Our men were very disinclined to come here, but
we had been cautiously feeling our way since leaving Milmil
to avoid any chance of a hostile attack. The Bertiri were very
civil to us, bringing us more milk than our men, with all their
great capacity, could drink. Crowds of the people came to our
camp and begged us not to go away, but to stay with them, as
they said the Abyssinians would never return while we were
camped here.</p>

<p>Having satisfied our curiosity, in the evening we marched
to Eil Bhai wells, arriving there as night closed in during a
rain-storm. Hartebeests abounded everywhere, and between
Jig-Jiga and Eil Bhai I shot a beautiful wild goose, which I
afterwards found common in Ogádén.</p>

<p>On the 3rd September, having halted for two hours to
let things dry a little, we marched at 8.30 to Makanis Hill,
arriving there at midday, the whole march being over the open
grass plains. Vast squadrons of hartebeests and of Sœmmering’s
gazelles, and some herds of oryx, were passed by us. We
also saw thirteen ostriches. It rained as night fell, and on the
4th of September a high wind blew, with rain and sleet, keeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
us in camp all day. On 5th September we descended into
the Harrawa Valley in the Gadabursi country, and back on to
the high <i>ban</i> again at Sarír, four days later. We then marched
along the base of the Harar Highlands, reaching Sala Asseleh
on 13th September. We had experienced heavy thunder-storms
with deluges of rain daily, and had found the whole
country deserted.</p>

<p>At Sala Asseleh we met a few Esa Somális who had just
left the Abyssinian post of Gildessa, now only half a day’s march
distant. They said that the Abyssinians were there in force.
We could get no one to go forward to warn the garrison of our
approach and peaceful intentions, the only native who knew
the country being required as a survey guide.</p>

<p>The next morning we made our final march into Gildessa.
We started early, and winding up a watercourse we entered low
trap hills, and after going four miles we came in sight of an
Abyssinian sentry-hut, perched on the top of a rocky hillock,
at a place where the path emerges from the hills and makes an
abrupt turn to the right into the Gildessa Gorge, down the side
of which it runs towards Zeila. On the rocks around us was a
large troop of dog-faced baboons, and there was no evidence,
beyond the small hut, that we were approaching a town.</p>

<p>I was marching a little ahead of the caravan, with my
brother and five or six camelmen; and turning to the right,
round a shoulder of the hill, we suddenly found, only one
hundred paces in front of us, the town of Gildessa—a group of
some hundred mat huts, with a few thatched ones and stone
houses. In the middle of the town is a stone zeríba sixty
yards square, with walls ten feet high, having an opening five
yards broad to allow of the ingress and egress of laden animals.</p>

<p>The hut we had noticed was the Abyssinian guard-house,
on a mound overlooking the two converging roads from
Harar and from Abósa to Gildessa, the latter being the road
we had traversed. On the west of the guard-house was the
bed of the Tug Gildessa, by the side of which wound the road
to Zeila, and this channel now contained a stream of running
water, which flowed to the east of the town.</p>

<p>The village through which we walked was very dusty, and
a swarm of people of mixed Eastern races blocked the way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
bartering cloth, tobacco, coffee, and other articles of trade; and
among the Abyssinians, Gállas, Somális, and Hararis I observed
several men of the black Soudánese type. We found the
assembled crowd very entertaining, and although the people
looked surprised at our sudden arrival they evinced no want of
friendliness. We sat down under some large shady trees on
the north side of the town, and were presently joined by the
elders, who were followed by several villainous-looking retainers
carrying Remington rifles and swords.</p>

<p>Taken up with this interesting crowd, we did not at first
notice the non-arrival of our caravan, which had only been a
few hundred yards behind us during the march; at length
missing the caravan, and inquiring the reason of delay, we were
told that the men and camels had been seized upon by the
Abyssinian soldiers who garrison the place, and taken into the
stone zeríba; they had been made to unload inside, and a
sentry had been put over the entrance to stop them from
coming out again.</p>

<p>This would not do! So running to the spot, we entered a
small house on the right side of the entrance; and there we
found, seated on carpets, writing, one Dágo, who was pointed
out to us as the Abyssinian in authority over the town. We
demanded an explanation, and Dágo said that he had seen our
caravan coming, and had decided that this would be a suitable
spot for our camp, and he had therefore ordered our men to
unload the camels.</p>

<p>We now strolled in to look at the place. Outside the
zeríba entrance, to the left, was a barrack; and on a wheezy
bugle sounding, about twenty soldiers, in white Soudánese
uniforms and armed with Remingtons, ran out and fell into
line. Another bugle, and they presented arms in rather a
fantastic fashion. They were then dismissed, and stood loafing
about outside the entrance.</p>

<p>We looked into the stone square and found our camels
sitting unloaded, our kit and boxes scattered about, lying where
they had been thrown from the camels on to the ground. Our
men were standing about, looking sullen and sheepish. The
zeríba was quite bare, without tree or shelter, exposed to a
powerful midday sun, and the ground was caked with camel’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
dung. We were told that this camping ground had been chosen
for our advantage, that we should be received with honour, and
that water and camel’s milk would be brought for the use of the
caravan. We thanked Dágo for his kind intentions, but said
we preferred camping under the trees by the river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 390px;" id="illus21">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Dágo and his friends made a thousand objections, and the
native officer in charge crowded the soldiers in front of the
stone enclosure. Our caravan had meanwhile been quietly
loading up the kit by our orders, but upon the camelmen trying
to lead out the camels, they were stopped by the soldiers, each
of whom carried his rifle loaded, with a few more cartridges
held between the fingers of the left hand, taken out of the belt
ready for instant use. One big Soudánese soldier stood across
the entrance with his rifle at the “port.”</p>

<p>We now saw the intention of the Abyssinian leader, and, as
it would never do for our Somális to suppose that we could be
detained against our will, we decided to take the next step;
and going up to Dágo, who was still sitting on the carpet inside
the little hut, I threatened to complain to Rás Makunan, the
Governor of Harar, if this attempt at our arrest should be persisted
in.</p>

<p>Dágo said that we ourselves might go where we liked, but
that our Somális, camels, and property must remain inside the
enclosure. We refused this separation, and told the officials
simply that we were going out. Some of the soldiers became
excited, and began shouting, but were silenced.</p>

<p>Again I walked over to Dágo, and he said the caravan
could not go without the order of the Rás; that it would take
till to-morrow at noon for a horseman to go to Harar and
get this order, and our party must be detained in custody
till then.</p>

<p>I stayed talking to him for a moment, while my brother
quietly told off an advance and rear-guard, passing the word
round for each of our followers to mark his man, and to put a
bullet into him should an attack be made upon us. I then
finally told Dágo that we were going, and walked to the
entrance, where my hunter Géli silently put into my hands the
double four-bore elephant rifle, loaded in each barrel with
fourteen drams of powder and fifty SSG slugs. This rifle, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
loaded, scatters a good deal, and would have been quite equal
to the occasion.</p>

<p>We had not mistaken our friend Dágo. The forces were
exactly equal, not counting the Gildessa crowd, some of whom
would have been for, and some against us, and seeing we were
capable of carrying our point, and afraid of the great responsibility
he would incur by using force, he called me back and
consented to our leaving, with our men, our camels, and our
baggage, provided I would write a letter to Rás Makunan, to
state why we had come to Gildessa. With my brother and
half a dozen men, all having their rifles ready, I entered Dágo’s
hut, and we sat down on the carpets in a circle, and he pushed
me a reed pen, ink, and paper.</p>

<p>I wrote a short note to the Rás in English, stating that we
had come to examine caravan routes for the Aden authorities,
and meant no harm. That we had also had some shooting,
and wished to go to Zeila; and I begged him to accept, as an
accompaniment to my letter, a pair of rhinoceros horns, those
of one of the two cows I had shot in the Dih Wiyileh.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian Dágo said he was sure Makunan would be
pleased at the trophy, which would be a very suitable compliment,
because only important Abyssinians are allowed to be
in possession of rhino horns. They make sword handles and
drinking-cups of them; the latter are supposed to neutralise the
effect of any poison poured into them. He sent our letter to
Makunan at once by a mounted messenger, at the same time
begging that we would wait encamped here till noon the next
day, when the answer might be expected.</p>

<p>We said we could leave Gildessa whenever we chose, but
that, as we wished to be on friendly terms with the local
authorities, and to respect their rules, we would camp under the
trees outside till the afternoon of the next day. We now
marched out and camped half a mile to the north of the town,
on the right bank of the river, at a spot where it was overlooked
by some low hills from a distance of a hundred yards.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the Abyssinian officials took us into their
own huts, in the town, and gave us tea, sitting on rugs. The
soldiers also were very friendly, and, now that business was
over, they forgot the late awkwardness, and tried to show us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
that they bore no ill-will, but had only tried to do what they
believed to be their duty to Rás Makunan. In the evening I
received them in my hut, giving them tea, which they seemed
to prefer to coffee.</p>

<p>When the Abyssinians were gone a large concourse of
Gildessa people came to camp, amongst them many Esa and
Arab merchants. They carried presents, among which were
three large sugar-cane stems, with spreading leaves, Indian-corn
cobs, potatoes, tomatoes, lettuce, and two sheep; all the
vegetables having been grown at Gildessa by the Abyssinians.
The Arab merchants were, some of them, Aden people;
they came clad in their best yellow and green silks; and being
versed in the tastes of the white man, heading the procession,
they brought us gravely, as an acceptable gift, a bottle of
absinthe carefully wrapped up in a wet cloth! Apparently this
and breech-loading small-arms form the chief articles of commerce
between the French port of Jibúti and Harar. Neither
Abyssinians, Esa, nor Arabs would accept any return present,
saying that we were their guests and not expected to give
anything.</p>

<p>The Esa insisted, before the Abyssinians, that they were
British “subjects.” One old man had been to London and
Bombay as a ship’s fireman; he advised us to send down to
Zeila and let the assistant Resident, Mr. Walsh, know of our
whereabouts, as “something might happen” if we were to try to
leave Gildessa.</p>

<p>Next morning a score or two of young warriors, with the
large Esa spear and shield, gave us a dance in honour of the
British Government, but it was cut short by a mounted
Abyssinian, Dágo’s son, who rode up on a pony from the town
and ordered them to desist. My own men all flew to arms and
stood ready for a row, and Géli handed me my four-bore,
suitably loaded as usual.</p>

<p>The Esa were silent for a moment; then, giving a derisive
roar of laughter, they went on with their dance, which was the
<i>dibáltig</i>, or acknowledgment of sovereignty, in our honour.
The Abyssinian galloped back to Gildessa, and returned with
the soldiers, marching two deep with loaded rifles; so the Esa
suddenly stopped dancing. A young Esa, of splendid physique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
came forward and asked whether we would like them to go on,
for, as he courteously put it, “the Esa were the obedient slaves
of the English.” Thanking him and his comrades, we said they
were under Abyssinian control here, and they must do as they
were bid.</p>

<p>They replied that they were sorry, for they felt great
friendship for us. The situation was for a moment awkward.
The Abyssinians and my own men stood drawn up opposite to
each other near my tent, the young Esa warriors in a sullen
group between the two, and a large crowd of Esa, Abyssinian,
Arab, and Gálla townspeople, armed with long guns, swords,
and spears, had collected on one side.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians were satisfied by my answer that I had
no intention of insulting them, and without further word the
commander marched them back to the town.</p>

<p>This was already the second hitch, and we were anxious to
get from Makunan the answer to my letter. We could not
foresee what trouble might arise with these sensitive Abyssinians
if we stayed long in Gildessa. We also thought that instead
of a letter reinforcements might be sent from Harar, and our
camp was in a spot difficult to defend.</p>

<p>By noon on the day of the Esa dance no answer had as
yet come from Harar; we had delayed over twenty-four hours
to please the Abyssinians, but now, the stipulated time having
expired, at 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> we began loading up.</p>

<p>Some Abyssinian scouts, who had been posted along the
road between our camp and Gildessa, reported our preparations
for departure to their commander, and a crowd of Arab
merchants and Esa elders came in haste to our camp to prevent
a quarrel; for they said that if we went without permission
we would certainly be attacked by the Abyssinians. They
put our staying so much in the light of a personal kindness to
themselves, that we agreed not to stay, but to march a mile or
two to a more defensible position, and camp for the night,
going on in the morning towards Zeila. If a large force should
by any chance come from Harar, our present camp was very
unfavourably situated.</p>

<p>The Esa elders said they were sorry, as if they were
ordered to seize our camels, and we used force, a fight would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
ensue; and a fight with the English was the last thing they
wanted.</p>

<p>We answered that we would also deplore this, but would
not allow our free right to go to Zeila to be questioned. So
we marched off, with most of the men formed into a rear-guard
thrown across the camel track and extended at about two
paces.</p>

<p>We followed the path which goes to the north between the
low hills and the forest which fringes the right bank of the
Gildessa stream. My brother afterwards crowned the hills with
part of the rear-guard, while I kept with the remainder in the
fringe of the woods covering the retreat till the caravan should
be clear of Gildessa.</p>

<p>A number of the Abyssinian and Soudánese soldiers ran
out with their rifles to stop us, but when they had come a
quarter of a mile they were recalled by a bugle from the barrack.</p>

<p>We camped after two miles, as we had promised our friends
the Esa and Arab merchants. It rained as we halted, but we
spent the first two hours of the night in fortifying our camp
with piled boxes of stores and rough timber from the thorn-trees,
so as to make them bullet-proof. We sent back word
notifying to the Abyssinians that we had camped, but that we
should make a very early morning march for Zeila; and we
asked that the Harar letter might be sent after us.</p>

<p>The messenger, on his return, reported that there had been
high talk among the Abyssinians of punishing our Esa guides
Boh and Hadji Adan, who had shown us the way to Gildessa,
but the other Esa in the town had said that if a hair of their
heads were touched the Abyssinians would have to deal with
themselves also. The Esa had then been driven out of the
town by the soldiers, who had formed line and charged them.</p>

<p>The Esa are accounted the bravest of any of the Somáli
tribes; they seldom or never use light throwing-spears, but
run up and stab at close quarters with the large, heavy, broad-bladed
spear. On a certain punitive expedition which occurred
in 1890,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> it is well known that they managed to get into a
zeríba full of regular troops, and, although beaten off, to leave
their mark inside; and as fighting men they are by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
to be despised. But having no guns they are obliged in
Gildessa to give in to the well-armed and numerous Abyssinians.</p>

<p>My brother and I watched by turns at this camp during
the whole night, and with the transit theodolite we took several
pairs of stars for latitude.</p>

<p>Sending three men half a mile back along the road to
Gildessa, to keep a look-out, we loaded by moonlight and
marched at 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and by dawn we had gone five miles along
a good track through thick jungle. At daylight we came to
Arrto, where Count Porro’s scientific expedition, including nine
Italian travellers, was destroyed in 1886. We crossed a wide
nala to the foot of a small hill, which was the last camping-place
of Porro’s party. Half a mile farther we came to the Garasleh
stream. The banks were beautifully wooded on both sides by
large thorn-trees covered with creepers, with an undergrowth
of aloes.</p>

<p>At dawn next day, at our camp at Warrji, where we had
put twenty-five miles between our caravan and Gildessa, a
number of Abyssinians came riding after us on mules, bringing
letters from Rás Makunan of Harar. The letters were
written in Amháric, and were couched in the most polite terms.
The Rás expressed himself glad to hear of the nearness to
Harar of British officers, and invited us to come to see him.
The bearer of the letter, who was the commander of the guard
at Gildessa, further said that one Gobau Desta had been sent
to Gildessa to arrange for the journey, and that by Gobau
Desta the Rás had courteously sent his own riding mule, with
embroidered state saddlery, for my use on the way. The Rás
thanked me also for the rhino horns. Alluding to our affair
with the Gildessa soldiers, the Rás significantly wrote, “If they
have been discourteous to you they shall reap their reward.”</p>

<p>I sent an answer to this, saying our time was not our own,
but that I hoped at some future opportunity, when on leave, to
pay him a visit. I said that the soldiers had naturally rather
lost their heads at our sudden arrival, but that they had treated
us with great hospitality.</p>

<p>On 20th September we arrived at Biyo-Kabóba fort, the
small post pushed out by the Abyssinians into the Esa country.
And as we approached the guard of fifteen men fired a salute in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
our honour. Strict orders had come from Harar that we were
to be given sheep, milk, and vegetables, that we were not to be
molested in any way, and above all, that the Odahgub White
Esa might dance to us if they liked. This they did, and I
took a photograph of them. I have never seen finer men in
any Somáli tribe than some of these Esa.</p>

<p>At So Madu, on 22nd September, a mail bag arrived from
Mr. Walsh, from Zeila, now about a hundred miles distant.
News contained in these letters necessitated my leaving my
brother to finish the traverse. I started for Zeila with two
attendants and my three Arab trotting camels. We slept on
the side of the track for two nights, arriving in Zeila on the
evening of the second day.</p>

<p>My brother marched down to Loyi-Ada, between Jibúti and
Zeila, to have a look at a palm-tree which is supposed to mark
the boundary between the French and British spheres of influence.
Here he had an amusing conversation in the pitch darkness with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a French officer, who thought he was trying to break the cholera
quarantine, the two parties of twenty men or so standing opposite
each other under arms; this awkwardness was followed by explanations,
my brother expressing regret that, through long
absence in the interior, he had no knowledge of the quarantine,
and the Frenchman apologising for having received him <i>en
troupier</i> under a misapprehension; and there followed a pleasant
breakfast with this official, who said he lived at Jibúti.</p>

<p>A few days before reaching Zeila my brother’s caravan was
struck down with sickness, caused by bad water, several men
having to be left at Ambós police-hut, and many more coming
into Zeila strapped on camels. I rode fifty miles on a very
hot day, with a native Indian hospital assistant and medicines,
in pursuit of my brother, but found he had come to Zeila by
another route.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Arriving at Zeila, we paid off the caravan and
returned to Aden. This was the last trip made in company
with my brother.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1892 I found myself able to undertake a
project which I had long formed,—that of spending my long
leave in Somáliland, and penetrating through the country to
explore Gállaland and the sources of the Juba, five hundred
miles inland. Having thought for several years of undertaking
this journey, when I was at last in possession of the opportunity
I had all the arrangements in my head. It occurred to me that
Rás Makunan’s invitation, received by me at Gildessa, might
be very useful, because such a visit would ensure respectful
treatment from any marauding Abyssinian soldiers whose path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
I might cross on my route to the Webbe. On the other hand,
there was a chance that Rás Makunan might put obstacles in
my way; but as he would get news of my journey in any case,
whether I went to Harar or not, I considered it best to visit
him, and laying before him my project, to trust in his intelligent
co-operation. I, moreover, thought Harar would be an
interesting place to visit, and I knew that Rás Makunan would
be glad of such a chance of exchanging ideas with a British
officer. I mentioned my project to the political authorities, who,
though not in a position to use my services, kindly allowed me to
go in from British ports. Eventually I started for Harar, armed
with eighteen Snider carbines, which were my own property, a
letter of recommendation to “all tribes whose countries I might
pass through” drawn up at the Residency, Aden; a note to
Rás Makunan from Signor Cecchi, the Italian Consul-General;
and a “round robin” in Arabic, from Sheikh Mattar of Hargeisa,
to all the mullahs, widads, and chiefs of the Malingúr and
Rer Amáden Somális, and of the Geriré Gállas beyond Imé.</p>

<p>The caravan, which I got together at Berbera on this
occasion, was the best equipped and manned that I have ever
done work with. The men were twenty-four picked Somális,
all of whom I had had under my command on many expeditions,
and they were chosen from among some two hundred
applicants for this particular trip.</p>

<p>In Aden I bought three Arab trotting camels and at Berbera
thirty-three Somáli baggage camels. I engaged Adan Yusuf
as caravan leader and interpreter, Géli and Hassan as hunters,
Dowra Warsama as guide, a cook, butler, and eighteen camelmen—in
all twenty-four men.</p>

<p>To Adan Yusuf I lent a Martini-Henry carbine, my
hunters carried my own spare big-game rifles, and the rest of
the men carried two Martini and eighteen Snider carbines. I
took one hundred and fifty rounds of ball ammunition per man,
a box of buckshot cartridges, and a box of blank ones for firing
salutes and signals, and for skirmishing drill. Fifty rounds per
man of the ball ammunition I expended in Bulhár and during
the journey in field-firing at targets.</p>

<p>Organising the caravan at Berbera, I marched to Bulhár,
and there remained a week to drill the men and put them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
through their target practice, during which time I was the
guest of Mr. Malcolm Jones, the political officer. While I
was at Bulhár Mr. Seton Karr arrived on a shooting trip, and
left for the south-west on the same day; I also heard that
Colonel Carrington of Poona was starting from Zeila into the
Gadabursi country to look for elephants.</p>

<p>My own private weapons were a double four-bore elephant
rifle carrying fourteen drs. of powder and a spherical ball, and
weighing twenty-one pounds; a double eight-bore Paradox, a
double .577 Express, all by Holland and Holland; and a long
Lee-Metford magazine rifle, a Martini-Henry, and a double
twelve-bore pistol.</p>

<p>There was a row going on among the coast people while
we were at Bulhár. Near Eil Sheikh, on the shore, fourteen
miles west of Bulhár, two men had fought in the jungle, a man
of the Ayyal Gadíd being killed by a man of the Rer Gédi
section of the Ba-Gadabursi Shirdone clan; after the duel the
Shirdone man had run away to his karia.</p>

<p>The whole of the Ayyal Gadíd sub-tribe who were in Bulhár
at once assembled to drive the Shirdone out of the town, and
Mr. Jones promptly shut up five of the slayer’s relatives in the
lock-up to prevent their being lynched. Next day he sent
half a dozen police, mounted on fast camels, to catch the
murderer, and in the evening I walked out with my host to a
crowd of Gadíd, who were burying the dead man wrapped up
in a white tobe, and we found that he had already been partly
eaten by hyænas before being brought in, as one fleshless arm-bone
was standing out from under the tobe.</p>

<p>We left Bulhár on 16th February, marched about twelve
miles, and camped at Eil Sheikh, between Elmas Mountain and
the sea. We took up eighty gallons of water at Eil Sheikh
for the waterless march of fifty miles to Kabri Bahr. On the
following day I got an <i>aoul</i> buck with the Martini-Henry
while on the march, the meat being very welcome. I saw a
good many oryx and followed a pair of ostriches, but both
without success, the flat-topped <i>khansa</i> bushes being very thick
and thorny, and difficult to get through. We reached Kabri
Bahr on the 19th, and Digan on the evening of the same day.</p>

<p>Here one of Colonel Carrington’s men came into camp from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the west, he having been sent to look for elephants. I sent a
note to the Colonel, whom I had met in India, giving him
notice that I was on a trip to the far interior, and would not
therefore interfere with his hunting ground; and I marched to
Ali Maan, where I found the country very much dried up, and
water scarce, owing to a very dry <i>Jilál</i> season and the failure
of the <i>Dair</i> or winter rains. The Rer Nur, Gadabursi, gave a
dance of fifty men, on foot, with spear and shield, in my honour;
and, as a return courtesy, I took a photograph of them. There
were two large karias here. The men professed themselves,
as usual all over Somáliland, to be English <i>ryots</i> (subjects),<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
and they made complaints against their neighbours, which
they wished me to settle. While I was at Ali Maan the Esa
attacked some Gadabursi and killed one of them, and in leaving
I passed a party of young men going out to try and find an
Esa to kill, and so square off the score.</p>

<p>In the Dibiri-Wein country, by a beautiful reed-margined
river-bed, in the wet sand I found the footmarks of a herd of
elephants which had passed about twenty-four hours before.
Following these for a mile I discovered, to my horror, imprinted
over them the uncompromising outline of an European boot!
The herd had been followed, not by Colonel Carrington, but by
another traveller. I left these footprints in deep disgust, without
even inquiring the name of their owner, and marching on
in haste I reached Gebili a few days later.</p>

<p>I was riding at noon ahead of the caravan, and had just
stopped to look at some old stone ruins half-buried in rocks and
grass, when my guide Daura ran up and reported, “Awálé is
killed,” and when the caravan came up it was headed by Awálé
Yasín strapped on a camel, in great pain, with his leg broken
below the knee, the tibia sticking out of the flesh for two or
three inches. He had been fixing a loose load when the camel
had fallen on him, crushing his leg. I gave him chlorodyne to
try and alleviate the pain. Then as we neared the camp we
lifted him off the camel, and four men bore him down the steep
descent of fifty feet to the Gebili watercourse, to the south of
which I pitched my tent. Following a sheep track, we soon
found a few shepherds of the Jibril Abokr, who were returning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
from watering their flocks. They sent a mounted messenger
to their karias, lying ten miles to the south, and next morning
a native expert at bone-setting arrived on the scene. I explained
I was not a doctor, and that the sick man might choose between
us; and he chose the Somáli, while I stood by to help and to
see fair-play. I am not responsible for the following method:—</p>

<p>First they washed the leg with warm water. There was a
gash some two inches wide, where the bone had come through.
The limb was pulled violently to get it straight, and the knee
was then bent till the calf pushed against the back of the thigh;
more pulling was done to get the broken bones in a straight
line, and then the bandaging began.</p>

<p>Cutting a tobe into strips we wound it round and round
the bent leg, a neat hole being made with the point of a spear
wherever the bandage came over the gash in the flesh, so as to
keep the wound exposed and thus allow of future inspection.
The whole of the bandage was covered with <i>subug</i>, or clarified
butter, as the work progressed.</p>

<p>Over the tobe bandage was wound a final wrapping of soft
<i>keirán</i> leather. The whole of this dressing was to remain on
for seven days, and then to be opened; if the bones had not
joined at the end of that time they were to be reset by the aid
of a wooden splint. If they had joined, a light bandage would
be again put on, and in a month he should be able to walk.</p>

<p>Awálé bore the pain without a sound, under circumstances
which would probably have caused an Asiatic or European to
yell, and next day I sent him off to the Jibril Abokr karias
strapped on a camel, with about two months’ rations of rice and
dates, and plenty of cloth to buy more; but it afterwards transpired
that the <i>hákim</i>, native-like, had bolted with the whole of
this and left Awálé to shift for himself. However, he managed
to get attended to by a good Samaritan from a passing caravan,
in the shape of a distant relation, who took him to Berbera,
where I found him four months afterwards; he was then able
to walk, but rather lame. A broken leg may not seem a great
matter, but happening away from any transport except a
baggage camel, and perhaps miles away from water in an
uninhabited wilderness, it becomes a terrible misfortune.</p>

<p>I went out for a stroll on the evening of 1st March from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Camp Gebili, quite alone, and walked along the sandy river-bed,
which is surrounded by rocky and bush-covered country; and
here I saw a hyæna rolling about in the sand, one hundred and
fifty yards away; and pitching up my rifle I hit him, breaking
his back, and walking up I finished his violent struggles with a
ball from my pistol. As I reached my tent a large panther
was heard coughing in the jungle to the east, no doubt prowling
round camp looking for one of my goats; so we tied up a kid
a hundred yards from my tent on the slope of the river bank,
and raising a small screen of thorn branches, I sat up with my
hunter Géli, five yards from the goat, to watch for the panther
by the light of the rising moon. After an hour, just as we had
begun to get tired of watching, and were nodding off to sleep,
the panther charged the goat and carried it away. The loop-hole
which we had prepared in our brushwood screen had been
too small, allowing no room laterally for a moving shot.</p>

<p>The panther carried away the kid at a gallop, and we
rushed after him in the moonlight over the rocky ground and
scrub, and made him drop it when he had gone some two
hundred yards from camp; we then dragged the carcase back
and secured it in the same place, tying its leg with a stout rope
to a stake hammered into the ground, the rope being smeared
with muddy water to make it less conspicuously white. We
also fastened a live goat by the side of the dead one.</p>

<p>After another wait of half an hour Hassan the Midgán, who
sat on my left, touched me gently and pointed. Looking up I
saw a panther’s head five yards from the goat, gray and ghostlike,
and next second in a flash he had sprung on the live goat’s
neck, but finding it fastened to the stake he let go and bounded
on, giving no time for a shot. I searched all next day in the
thick <i>ergín</i> jungle round camp, but failed to put him up, but
we found a cave which had evidently been his lair.</p>

<p>On the next night I again went for a walk along the river-bed
alone, and saw the mate of the hyæna I had killed the
night before; but I held my fire for fear of driving away any
panthers or leopards from the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I sat up again, and at eight o’clock, while it was still nearly
dark, a large leopard charged the goat at full gallop, and I fired
without looking along the sights, the light being too dim for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
me to see the platinum bead. I fired a snap-shot with my
eyes thrown upon the bait as the grey silhouette of the leopard
pounced on to it, and pulled the trigger at random as it for a
moment obscured the white form of the goat; the leopard left
the goat struggling and bounded away across the river. The
smoke hung heavily, and even when it had cleared away I
could only make out the white outline of the goat in front,
lying in its death throes; beyond that the black silhouette of
the bush-covered hill, and the white light in the sky which
would soon be replaced by the disc of the rising moon. I
distinctly heard the leopard spring up the hill on the other
side of the river; and then she stopped, growling at intervals,
and evidently badly wounded, for I could hear the cracking
branches of the thorn bushes and the sound of displaced stones
as she rolled about.</p>

<p>I went to camp and fetched a lantern and several men;
and taking up the tracks, holding the lantern close to the
ground, we found a great deal of blood and shreds of her
stomach which had been dropped as she had galloped across
the river-bed. We held a whispered conference, and decided
that if we waited till the morning to follow her up, with this
fearful wound she might die in the night and hyænas would
spoil the skin. Several men then began throwing small stones
up on to the hillside amongst the bushes where we thought
she must be lying, but she refused to show her hiding-place.</p>

<p>The Somális offered to form line and drive her out by the
light of the moon. I tried to show them the foolhardiness of
this; but as they were bent on it, and further hesitation on my
part would have been misinterpreted, I arranged a line of twelve
men with Snider carbines, and placing myself at its head, we
cautiously worked up the hillside. The leopard was very quiet
now, and gave no sign. The moon was getting brighter, as it
had risen well above the horizon clear of the hill and bushes,
shining down into our faces as we ascended.</p>

<p>The men were straggling and would not keep proper line,
in spite of my constant directions. We had made three unsuccessful
casts up and down the hill, when the leopard charged
down from the top, with a coughing roar, right in our faces.
The men bunched up round me and I could not fire,—indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
no one had time to fire. She came down the hill in three or
four tremendous bounds, and the next second her shadowy
form had sprung on Esmán Abdi, who was next to me on the
left, and leopard and man, locked together, rolled down the
hill, brushing past my leg. Libán Gúri, the man on the farther
side of Esmán Abdi, placed the muzzle of his carbine against
the leopard’s shoulder, actually singeing the skin, the bullet
passing through the leopard and ricochetting within a few
inches of my foot, scattering the gravel over me; the brute let
go Esmán Abdi, or rather Esmán let go her, for he had had
her safe by the throat from the first; and she rolled over in
her last agony, fixing her claws into everything within reach,
until I fired with the muzzle against her ribs and settled her.</p>

<p>Esmán ran down the hill, and we all followed him, calling
out to know how much he was wounded; and when we overtook
him he said he wasn’t running from the <i>shabél</i>, but was
very much afraid of our bullets! He was badly clawed about
the arms, but having caught the leopard by the throat in the
first rush, and never let go his hold, he had got off without
feeling her teeth, although he had several abrasions from falling
among the rocks.</p>

<p>We took the leopard to my tent and skinned it by firelight,
while by the same fire I dressed Esmán Abdi’s wounds with
carbolic oil. The first shot fired at the leopard as she charged
the goat had taken her in the centre of the belly, and torn quite
half of the intestines away, and with this wound she had waited
quietly for us, and had died game!</p>

<p>On the 3rd of March we left Gebili, and at the end of
an afternoon march of three and a half hours halted at noon
on the northern edge of the great Marar Prairie, at Ujawáji,
near the spot where I had been mauled by a lion a few months
before. A glorious view lay before us, the row of conical hills
called Subbul rising out of the plain some twenty-five miles
away; and another twenty-five miles beyond could be seen the
long blue line of the Harar Highlands, at the edge of which lay
Jig-Jiga the Abyssinian post by which I must pass before
marching to the city of Harar. By the evening of the 4th of
March we had reached Júk, a grassy bottom in the undulating
bush-covered country leading up to Subbul Odli, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
a dome-shaped hill, the top being two or three hundred feet
above the surrounding ground and some six thousand feet
above the level of the sea. Between Bulhár and Júk the whole
country passed over had been under the influence of a very
severe <i>Jilál</i>, or dry season, but at Júk we found that recent rain
had fallen, and young grass was just shooting up all over the
plain, the thorn bushes being already a mass of green.</p>

<p>On the evening of our arrival at Júk I left the three trotting
camels in camp and strolled out on foot; I found oryx
abundant here, and after a careful crawl through old high grass,
hit two mortally with a right and left, but, to my sorrow, night
closed in while I was following them, and I had to leave them
to die in the bush.</p>

<p>At dawn the next morning the caravan marched on for
Subbul Odli, while I went back on foot with Géli and Hassan
to look for the oryx wounded the night before. I found one, a
large cow, still standing, and gave her a finishing shot; and
two or three hundred yards farther I found the other, a bull,
already killed and eaten by hyænas; but the skull, carrying a
very fine pair of horns, I took away, and as much of the meat
of the cow as we could carry.</p>

<p>Soon after overtaking the caravan I started a large herd,
followed by what is perhaps the greatest meat delicacy,
a young calf oryx; and as the meat of the cow was scarcely
enough for my followers, I shot him. At noon we reached
Subbul Odli and camped half a mile from the hill, in open
park-like country. There was at the foot of Subbul Odli a
beautiful forest of the <i>wádi</i>, a thorn-tree with an upright light
gray or lemon-yellow stem, bare to about ten feet from the
ground, and then spreading out flat at the top into small stems
in the form of an inverted cone. It is a tree of great beauty,
and is covered with thorns two or three inches long. This
tree gives out a gum which the Somális eat. It was now the
<i>Kalíl</i>, or great heat before the monsoon, and we experienced
the first thunder-storms while at this camp.</p>

<p>Continuing our journey towards Jig-Jiga, I saw immense
quantities of hartebeests on the open plains, one herd containing
quite a thousand individuals, and three herds of about five
hundred each; and plenty of smaller herds and solitary bulls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were scattered about near the horizon. All the game was rather
wild, but I shot two buck Sœmmering’s gazelles by a right and
left, as a long line of these animals galloped past me extended
at full speed, the setting sun glancing on their sleek hides; and
we camped where they had fallen, on the short grass of the
open plains, my tent being within half a mile of Gumbur Dug,
a small rounded hillock which takes its name from the <i>Dúg</i>, or
large gadfly. Four Ayyal Yunis traders came to me here, to
lay before me, as a representative of the English, complaints
against the Abyssinians; and some of the Jibril Abokr tribe
joined us, with their flocks, for protection while passing the
frontier.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hartebeest</span> (<i>Bubalis swaynei</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>Marching into Jig-Jiga on the side of rising ground, opposite
the Abyssinian stockaded earthwork, I was promptly visited by
a <i>Shúm</i>, or petty officer, and twenty Abyssinian soldiers, who
all carried sabres and Remington rifles. Rumours were afloat
that the Abyssinian leader, Banagúsé, having heard that an
English force was marching up to take Jig-Jiga, was bringing
an army against me from his place at Gojar in the hills. The
Bertiri said that the soldiers at Jig-Jiga had been on the point
of leaving in a fright, but that we had come unexpectedly early
in the day, and so caught them in the stockade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>I sat up for a panther in the evening, in a wretched shelter,
when it was pitch dark; and a spotted hyæna charged my goat
and took it away from under my very nose; but the light was
too bad for me to fire, and I returned much disgusted to camp,
picking my way home in the dark.</p>

<p>At midnight my caravan leader, Adan Yusuf, woke me up
to say that he had received news that Banagúsé was coming to-morrow
with two hundred soldiers, and had sent for a reinforcement
of two hundred more; and that Banagúsé had said
to his people that he would arrest me, whoever I was, and find
out the reason of my coming afterwards.</p>

<p>Accordingly, next morning Banagúsé marched into the
Jig-Jiga Valley with the large escort of nearly four hundred
horse and foot, armed chiefly with Remington rifles. The
force was one of organised troops, so far as the Abyssinian
military system goes, and the rifles were superior to the Snider
carbines of my escort. I watched them for many miles as they
advanced over the plain, by the aid of a large astronomical
telescope, which we set up on a tripod in camp. The force
halted outside the Abyssinian zeríba, eight hundred yards from
my camp, a dip of open grass-land, forming the Jig-Jiga Valley,
lying between us. Banagúsé went into the zeríba, the bulk of
the soldiers squatting down outside, gossiping and holding the
horses of those Abyssinian chiefs who had been mounted.</p>

<p>Soon Banagúsé’s headman or <i>Shúm</i>, Abadigal, came spurring
across the valley to my camp, mounted on a beautiful gray
Abyssinian mare, with a message to the effect that the great
man was “at home” in the zeríba, and that he had sent for me.
Remembering what had been told me of Banagúsé’s intention
to arrest me, I sent back Abadigal to say I would meet
Banagúsé half-way if he would go into the valley with a few
men only; and I pointed out a conspicuous red ant-hill where
we might meet. Abadigal soon returned, saying his master
expected me to go to the zeríba, and that he would wait for me
there.</p>

<p>Mounting my Arabian trotting camel, and followed by all my
nineteen men, leaving only one sentry in camp, I rode out to
the ant-hill, and sat there for ten minutes; but Banagúsé not
arriving, being tired of the hot sun, I trotted back again; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
on Abadigal coming on one of his frequent errands across the
valley, I sent him to tell Banagúsé that he might go back
to Harar if he liked, but that I should stop where I was, and
unless he behaved civilly I would prefer not seeing him at all;
moreover, I warned him that my men were few, and that if he
brought his crowd with him to my camp I should take it as a
hostile act, but that if he came with only a small party I should
be glad to welcome him, and give him a reception befitting a
man of such rank.</p>

<p>I waited another half-hour, and then I saw through the
telescope that the people squatting round the zeríba began to
stir, and Banagúsé and his chiefs came out and formed the
whole force into a long line facing my camp. The chief
mounted, and the line began to cross the valley in my direction;
and very picturesque they looked. I longed for a shot at them
with my “Ideal” hand camera, but not anticipating such a
subject I had put in no plates the night before. As they got
nearer I could see the silver-mounted shields and black sheepskin
capes of the men, and the rich trappings of the horses,
some of the bridles being hung with rows of silver dollars,
glittering in the sun. Banagúsé rode in the centre on a white
horse, and the line was an irregular formation about two or
three deep. On my right a large crowd of Bertiri Somáli
horsemen had assembled to watch the expected disturbance,
and the whole picture was one of the brightest and most exciting
I have ever seen in Somáliland.</p>

<p>I was determined that if Banagúsé wanted to arrest me he
would have to use force; and I knew he could not do this because,
after the attempted arrest of my brother and myself at
Gildessa the year before, Rás Makunan had given strict orders
to his frontier generals to treat British travellers with courtesy;
so on the whole I decided that if in the game of “bluff” I
preserved a tolerably firm attitude, Banagúsé would simply
have to give in, and my expedition to Ogádén would be saved
from failure.</p>

<p>Calling my men, twenty in all, and forming them into an
irregular line, I went out on foot into the valley to meet
Banagúsé, hoping devoutly that he would halt his people
and come on with two or three in a proper manner. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the Abyssinians continued to advance! I was intensely
annoyed that Banagúsé should insist on bluffing, and we
all determined not to give in. A few seconds only would
decide the matter now, as the array had come to within
a hundred and twenty yards, and was every moment getting
nearer. I now ordered my men to lie down, and advancing
with two of them I waved to Banagúsé to come forward to
meet me, and to halt his people. My signs being taken no
notice of I blew a whistle, and the men ran up and formed
round me into a rallying group, outer circle kneeling and
inner circle standing, and a cartridge was shoved into the
breech of every rifle. Several of the Abyssinians dropped down
ready to fire at a word from their chief, and my Somális made
ready, on the order, to aim at the little man on the white horse,
riding in the middle of the throng.</p>

<p>Banagúsé wheeled his horse quickly and addressed his
people. He had at last been beaten in the game, and a wave
passed along the opposing line which we had been watching
with such concentrated interest, and they all sat down. Banagúsé
trotted forward on his white horse, followed by Abadigal and
two others, and I walked towards him with my interpreter,
Adan Yusuf, and two men. Banagúsé took the sheepskins
from the shoulders of the two soldiers and spread them on the
ground; and we sat down side by side on the open plain, near
my original ant-hill, the dark Abyssinian force being eighty
yards in front, and my camelmen ten yards behind; and about
a hundred Bertiri horsemen, sitting in the saddle, formed a
picturesque group on my right.</p>

<p>Banagúsé complimented me on my military movements,
and asked the reason of them. I asked why he had advanced
with all his force, against my wish, distinctly made known to
him through Abadigal. “Oh!” he said, “this crowd was
brought in your honour; it is the custom.” So, not to be
behind him with a soft answer, I said, “This is also an English
custom, to do you honour;” and so we parted, shaking hands;
and I marched back my own men to my camp, and Banagúsé
crossed the valley to his zeríba, followed by his little army.</p>

<p>In the afternoon an Abyssinian named Gabratagli came to
me with a small escort, having just arrived from Daríma, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
village in the Highlands about a day’s march distant. He was
an agent of Menelek, and had been appointed to inspect routes
and regulate caravan fees. He reported that Rás Makunan
had just arrived at Harar after his visit to Shoa, but had not
yet had time to hear of my coming. Gabratagli had, however,
heard of it, and had come in haste from Daríma to bid me
welcome to the country on his own responsibility, as he knew
of my correspondence with the Rás at Gildessa last year, and
of Makunan’s wish to know British officers. Gabratagli behaved
with great courtesy, and assured me that Rás Makunan
would be delighted to hear that I had come at last. He said
that the people on the frontier were all mad, and suspicious of
the English, but that now he had come all would go well with
me. Gabratagli and his friends finished my small stock of
whisky and cigarettes; and cheered by the comforts of my
table, they became very friendly and communicative.</p>

<p>It appears that Banagúsé is a <i>Taurari</i> or “general
commanding the advance guard.”<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> He is in some ways an
able man, and is setting up a place for himself at the advanced
post of Gojar under Gureis Mountain, just inside the Harar
Highlands; and it is said he wishes to found another Harar
there. He has the reputation of being disobedient to his
superiors and tyrannical to the Géri and Bertiri Somális. He
is unpopular in Somáliland, and, if all reports are true, he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
not likely to forward British interests. He is the worst of
those who extract cattle from Somáliland without paying,
under the pretence of collecting tribute for the Emperor;
he has made many requisitions on the Habr Awal tribe,
which is under British protection; and, moreover, his raids on
the Ogádén cattle are likely to damage our meat-supply at
Aden in the near future.</p>

<p>According to a story which I have heard on fairly good
authority, Banagúsé’s history is as follows:—A few years
back, in Shoa, he somehow incurred the displeasure of the
Emperor Menelek, and the latter ordered that he should be
disgraced and punished. When the Abyssinians took Harar,
Banagúsé so distinguished himself that Rás Makunan gave
him charge of Jarso District, in which lies the village of Gojar,
commanding the Hilindéra Pass; and the fort of Jig-Jiga,
commanding the Karin Marda Pass, both of which lead from
Berbera and Hargeisa to Harar; he appears, however, to have
done nothing for the country, taking quantities of horses and
cattle away to feed the troops, and exacting double road fees
from Berbera caravans. The Emperor Menelek, who had in
the meantime almost forgotten Banagúsé’s existence, hearing
the Somáli complaints, sent Gabratagli to Daríma to check the
caravan fees; so naturally the two officials were not exactly
friends.</p>

<p>Gabratagli was a cheery old man, wearing a tobe, a pair of
white calico drawers, and an immense straw hat. He kept a
piece of calico soaked in butter over his shaven skull, under
his hat, “to keep his head cool,” as he said he was a martyr to
neuralgia. He rode a white mule, and had an athletic soldier,
dressed in calico drawers, constantly at hand with his drinking-cup
and a mysterious bottle, which did not contain water. I
took a great liking to this old man.</p>

<p>Gabratagli had travelled much, and had often visited
Aden; and he asked me concerning the health of English
officers whom he had met many years before, whose names
I had never heard; and on my admitting this, he remarked,
“If you don’t remember these you must be very
young.” Before he left my camp he sent a mounted messenger
to Harar with a letter from me to the Rás, and he asked me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
to stay at Jig-Jiga for three or four days till the answer should
have had time to arrive.</p>

<p>It was not till nearly sunset that Banagúsé came over,
bringing his whole force across the valley to my camp. I fired
a salute as he came in, my men being very pleased, and thinking
themselves great soldiers after the morning’s display. I insisted
on his halting his people two hundred yards from camp, and
bringing only twenty men with him; and to show him that I
did not like his methods, I ordered my men to squat down in
a circle round the door of my reception tent, and leading
Banagúsé and a few chiefs through a lane of my men, I sat
down among them with my loaded rifle leaning against a chair
and my revolver on. The few soldiers whom Banagúsé brought
with him were allowed to wander about the camp at will, one
sentry keeping a watchful eye over them. They treat their
long Remington rifles shamefully, leaning on them with the
muzzles half buried in the earth. Their custom is to keep
these rifles loaded while on the Somáli frontier, but not, I
believe, in Harar.</p>

<p>I found Banagúsé very intelligent, and his features are well
cut and regular, very unlike those of the coarse-featured soldiers.
I noticed the Somális have much better features than the
Abyssinian soldiers, and smaller hands and feet. I should
think Banagúsé must have Arab blood in his veins; although
polite, he was not at all disposed to be friendly to me; he
knew that I had taken photographs of his stockade on my last
visit while he was away, and complained of him to the British
Government.</p>

<p>There was a report in my camp that the force he had
collected at Gojar was getting ready to attack an Italian who
was said to have settled down on the Milmil-Imé route at
Sassamani, in Ogádén. At the time I thought of Prince
Ruspoli, but subsequently found that the object of the attack,
which never came off, was to have been Colonel Paget, who had,
I afterwards heard, with great justice restored some looted
camels to the Ogádén while on a shooting trip in their country.</p>

<p>During my interview with Banagúsé, Mahomed Ahmed,
the poor Gerád or sultan of the Bertiri Somális, sat in my tent
looking dejected and never daring to utter a word; it appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
his dignity had suffered at the hands of the Abyssinians during
the last few months, he being obliged to “trot about like a
dog” between the karias to fetch cows for the soldiers to eat.
The Gerád was slightly built, and had the intelligent face and
well-cut features of the best kind of Somáli, a great contrast to
the coarse-featured soldiers who were allowed to hector over
him. Despite his old, worn-out tobe he still looked dignified.
Before the arrival of these Abyssinians, who came into the
Bertiri country like a swarm of locusts when they took Harar,
the Gerád had been a man of some repute. But the
Abyssinians took away all his power, and he is now of little
consequence.</p>

<p>My intercourse with Banagúsé depended on several interpreters;
he spoke Amháric to Gabratagli, who passed it on to
my interpreter, Adan Yusuf, in Arabic, and the latter translated
into Hindustáni for my benefit. By the time a sentence reached
me Banagúsé was thinking of something else, so we did not make
much progress.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians preferred tea to coffee; and I noticed
Banagúsé rather craned at his cup, and handed it to a friend
first, suspecting poison. But my headman, Adan Yusuf, full
of tact, said quietly, “<i>Mafish khoff</i>” (No fear), and giving a short
laugh, he took a long draught from the cup, and filled it again
for the great man.</p>

<p>On 9th March, in the early morning, Banagúsé sent over
Abadigal to say he was leaving for Gojar, and requesting that
I would visit him in the stockade; so posting a sentry in camp
I took nineteen of the men in line, rode across the valley, and
drew up at the Abyssinian zeríba. Leaving most of the men
outside I entered with four, passing a sentry who saluted me
by presenting arms in Abyssinian fashion; and walking across
the zeríba, I entered Banagúsé’s hut. Here I found his notables
assembled, all seated on the ground. I was invited to take my
place on a raised platform with Banagúsé, while Adan Yusuf
and the other interpreters squatted in front. Banagúsé was
polite, but having little to say, he left Gabratagli to do all the
talking.</p>

<p>After a somewhat embarrassing leave-taking I trotted back
to camp on my camel, and Banagúsé issued from the stockade;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and, followed by his army, he marched over the plain towards
Gojar; and looking with my telescope from camp an hour later,
I made them out in the far distance, and it was pleasant to
have seen the last of them.</p>

<p>I was glad to halt at Jig-Jiga for a few days, as the plains
were dotted all over with game. My men were a thoroughly
good lot of fellows, and I was particularly pleased with the
way in which they had enabled me to show a bold front to
Banagúsé.</p>

<p>One day I went out into the plains with three or four men,
and found immense herds of hartebeests and Sœmmering’s
gazelles; but the day being windy, they were very shy. The
gazelles were always galloping about and starting the masses
of oryx and hartebeests. They would draw up in front of the
larger game, appearing to know that I did not want to fire at
them, sometimes giving me very easy chances. At last, seeing
no chance of the larger game, and being in want of meat, I
shot two Sœmmering’s gazelles right and left, one a very good
buck with a thick winter coat; and on the way to camp I saw
a bull hartebeest standing, as he thought, out of range, some
four hundred yards away, so I lay prone and brought him down
with a careful shot from the Martini-Henry.</p>

<p>Returning to camp, I found messengers from one Farur
Gerád Hirsi, a relation of the Bertiri Sultán, who was at his
karia two miles away, and had “pains all over his body,” so he
had sent his sons to call me. I gave him twenty drops of
chlorodyne and half a dozen quinine pills, one to be taken daily.
I was received with great enthusiasm by a crowd of some two
hundred of his womenfolk and male relations, all calling out
“<i>Nabad</i>” (Welcome). The Gerád said he would have had himself
carried to my camp, but not while the hated Abyssinians
remained there. The elders flocked around me to lay complaints
before me of the treatment they had received from the Abyssinian
invaders. They said that Banagúsé was lazy, and did not
administer the country a bit; that he and his mob were neither
good at fighting nor governing, and that the only thing they
could do was bullying the karias for the extraction of cattle,
which his soldiers eat raw. The Gerád told me that ten cows
were taken last month from his karia alone. Another man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Ibrahim Gúri (Rer Ali), lost seventy-six camels, two hundred
sheep, and five huts in one day; and he and his wife were
arrested and taken away by the Abyssinians towards Harar.
These are samples of the arbitrary behaviour of frontier officials.</p>

<p>At night I returned to my camp from the Gerád’s karia,
across torrent beds and wait-a-bit thorns, and learnt the lesson
that it is much better to cross one deep ravine low down than
the twenty or more tributary ravines from which it is formed. We
got to camp at last, relieved in our minds, because the presence
of a man-eating lion in this neighbourhood had made us feel
rather uncomfortable when stumbling about amongst the ravines
in the darkness of the night.</p>

<p>Next morning I sent a haunch of venison to Gabratagli,
done up with clean white foolscap paper pinned round it, with
a pencil memorandum in English conveying my compliments,
as it seemed to me it would do no harm to be polite. My
armed Somáli camelman who took it seemed to think it a
great joke, and trotted across the half mile of valley to the
Abyssinian zeríba in pouring rain, singing cheerfully; and he
returned saying my friend was delighted, but, my Somáli asked,
“Why did I waste my good venison on such pigs?”</p>

<p>At midday on the 11th came news that Rás Makunan had
returned to Harar from Shoa; and at eight o’clock at night
Gabratagli sent over the Rás’s letter, with an interpreter. The
Rás expressed himself very pleased that I had carried out my
promise, made last year, to visit him, and hoped I would come
at once, adding that Gabratagli had received orders to make
all arrangements for my coming.</p>

<p>On the 13th March we left Jig-Jiga and crossed the plains
to Hádo, just inside the Harar Hills; and we camped at
Abadigal’s own village. We had now left the Marar Prairie,
inhabited by Somáli nomads, and had crossed the border of
the Harar Hills, descending by the Marda Pass into undulating
country occupied by the cultivating Géri and Bertiri, whose
permanent villages are clustered about everywhere, and are
controlled by Abyssinian magistrates, whose title is <i>Shúm</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Shúm</i> who was my host was Abadigal, Banagúsé’s
right-hand man, whom I had seen lately at Jig-Jiga; he was
a good fellow, broad-shouldered and good-natured, and looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
very imposing in his military dress, with a black sheepskin
cape and a long curved sabre; and although the Bertiri villagers
detest the Abyssinian occupation as a principle, Abadigal
enjoys the personal respect of those under him.</p>

<p>The pass by which we entered the mountains is called Karin
Marda, and is very prettily wooded, the road having a greatest
elevation of about six thousand five hundred feet above sea-level.
A great change came over the landscape as we topped the pass.
Behind us lay a thickly-wooded slope descending to the immense
Marar Prairie, covered generally with short grass without a single
bush, which is a thousand square miles in area, and has a greatest
length of fifty miles and a greatest breadth of thirty-six miles,
with a mean elevation of five thousand five hundred feet above
sea-level. In front of us, at our feet, the road wound through
picturesque forest for half a mile, and then the whole face of
the country was covered with <i>jowári</i> cultivation and clusters of
substantial villages. Beyond, to the south-west, rose ridge
upon ridge of blue hills and deep valleys, among which, some
forty miles away, lay the city of Harar. To the right towered
the tremendous mass of Kondurá (or Kondudo) to about ten
thousand feet, and beyond Harar a similar mass, called Gara
Muláta, shut out the view to the west.</p>

<p>At this season we found the signs of cultivation to consist
only of old stubble; the land was being ploughed up to receive
the new seed, the dry season being nearly at an end and
the monsoon rains expected shortly.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Everywhere, in pairs or
singly, oxen were drawing the primitive Bertiri plough, and the
country had a peaceful look after the thorn forests and open
grass plains of the nomad Somális, where sheep and camel
paths, and zeríbas, had been almost the only evidences of
human occupation.</p>

<p>The <i>Shúm</i> kindly gave me his house, a very substantial
dwelling fifteen feet high and eighteen feet in diameter, made
in a circular form, of stout saplings and <i>jowári</i> stalks, with a
beehive-shaped roof of the same material, covered by ten inches
of neat layers of thatched grass; and altogether it formed as
clean, well-built, and comfortable a dwelling, for the climate, as
one could wish. As we got intensely cold night winds at this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
elevation (five thousand five hundred feet), I was glad indeed
to exchange my “Cabul” tent for Abadigal’s hut. The state of
the thermometer, which sometimes can go down to 49° and 50°
Fahr. in the early mornings, does not accurately describe the
cutting nature of a Somáli night wind, the more keenly felt
when one has been travelling all day under a burning <i>Jilál</i> sun.</p>

<p>An Abyssinian soldier brought me a present of fifteen fresh
hen’s eggs; I offered payment, but he refused, saying that eggs
were of no value, and a great many good ones were daily thrown
away as refuse. Somalis do not keep fowls, so I was delighted
at the change of food.</p>

<p>Mahomed Ahmed, the Gerád of the Bertiri tribe, visited me
at Abadigal’s hut, with the same old story; he said that the
Bertiri wished for the arrival of anybody in European shape
who would administer the country and save them from the
Abyssinians. He said, as an inducement, that any Europeans
taking over the country would make plenty of money;
he added that ever since I had come to Jig-Jiga he had
been kept on the run, carrying messages to various villages
many miles away, or looking for cattle, because the Abyssinians
wanted to prevent his coming to me. He had crept to my hut
stealthily by night; and of course I warned him of the danger
he exposed himself to. He said that my arrival threw the
Jig-Jiga garrison into a great state of alarm. My friends the
Bertiri, I found, loving to make mischief, had magnified my
difficulties with Banagúsé into a great British victory over the
Abyssinians! I believe that half the Abyssinian suspicion of
English designs on the frontier is due to Somáli gossip.</p>

<p>We set out from Hádo at daylight, and leaving cultivation
after an hour, we descended by a road, bad for camels, into the
beautiful valley of Helmók, camping by the margin of a running
stream. This valley, which leads into the Tug Fáfan to
the south-east, is covered with forest and dense undergrowth,
where the latter has not been burnt off by jungle fires. It has
been a favourite resort of elephants and rhinoceroses, but since
the Abyssinians came to Harar their numbers have diminished,
and we only saw the track of one bull rhinoceros, which had
come to drink at the stream two nights before.</p>

<p>Marching from Helmók in the afternoon, we arrived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
village of Kanyasmatch Basha-Basha, which lies on the saddle
between two very remarkable hills called Eilalami, the village
itself being called Bakaka. To the west of the Eilalami ridge is
Feyambiro, and to the east is Bursúm.</p>

<p>The country between Helmók stream and the Eilalami
ridge is a beautiful, well-watered valley, covered with forest,
uncultivated and used as pasture by the Géri and Bertiri flocks
at the proper season. The ascent to the saddle on which
Bakaka village stood was steep for camels, and we wound
through this large village after dark, threading our way through
a crowd of Abyssinian, Gálla, and Harari villagers, and yelping
pariah dogs, till we reached Basha-Basha’s house.</p>

<p>The rank of <i>Kanyasmatch</i> may be described as that of
General commanding the right wing of an Abyssinian army.
Fi Taurari Banagúsé and Kanyasmatch Basha-Basha are the
two commanders who respectively lead the Abyssinian advance
into the Bertiri and Habr Awal countries to the north, and the
Ogádén to the east.</p>

<p>I was led into a large stockaded enclosure behind Basha-Basha’s
house, where a tent had been prepared for me. This
tent was fourteen feet in diameter across the floor and of bell
shape, with perpendicular walls seven feet high hanging to the
ground all round. The centre pole was twelve feet high, of male
bamboo grown, I think, in Abyssinia, and the material of the tent
was a single thickness of American shirting. We had to wait
outside a while, among a crowd of gaping villagers and dogs,
while the tent was being prepared with carpets for my reception.
On entering it I met Basha-Basha, who welcomed me to his
village. He was a little man, sparely built, and had lost his
left eye. He had an abrupt, peremptory way of talking, but he
was said to be very popular and to have a great reputation for
straightforwardness, being kind to his inferiors and “very terrible
in war.” Fortunately I had not to test his fighting powers, but
I found him everything that could be wished for as a host, and
he impressed me more favourably than any of the Abyssinians
whom I had met. He apologised for not being in his dress of
ceremony on the ground that he was in mourning; but next
day he very kindly condescended to put on his cape of lion-skin
and a black velvet waistcoat covered with embroidery, to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
me the costume. He admired my big-game rifles, being much
delighted with the double four-bore, weighing twenty-two pounds,
which he said was the right gun to kill elephants with. I heard
that Basha-Basha when a child was adopted by the wife of
Rás Makunan, and through this connection with the family of
the Rás and his own ability he had advanced to his present post.</p>

<p>On the 15th I remained all day in Basha-Basha’s tent,
occasionally appearing at the entrance to show myself to the
crowd which had come to see me. In the evening I wanted to
go for a walk, so, as an excuse, I proposed to visit Feyambiro.
I had the greatest difficulty in persuading Basha-Basha and
Gabratagli that I was not going to choose the site for an
English fort there. They thought it most extraordinary that
I should want to go for a walk, and Basha-Basha quietly ordered
a detachment of soldiers to go with me! I carried out my intention,
going four miles along a very uninteresting public path
covered with people passing to and fro, between cultivated fields,
and we came to a few huts belonging to a caravan of Berbera
traders; and this, I was told, was Feyambiro, where all caravans
from Somáliland unload and change to donkey transport, leaving
the camels to graze at Feyambiro, as the road ahead, over the
twenty-five miles to Harar, winds through deep gorges and is
too rough for camels. Gabratagli asked why I should want to
see Feyambiro, when I would pass it on the morrow while
going to Harar. I got the exercise, but did not enjoy the trip,
because I was dogged the whole way by a hundred Gálla
peasants and Abyssinian soldiers.</p>

<p>We set out from Basha-Basha’s on the morning of the 16th
March at seven o’clock. I left all the camels and camp at
Feyambiro, taking on with me only my servants and a little
personal baggage, the transport of mules and porters being
supplied free of charge by Gabratagli. Passing over very hilly
country intersected by deep gorges, we arrived at Harar at 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>,
being escorted for the last two or three miles by several
companies of the soldiers of the Rás, in clean white dress, to
the number, as I subsequently ascertained, of about a thousand.</p>

<p>As we arrived at the head of each company, the men
presented arms in the Abyssinian way, and were marched off
in front or in rear of the procession according to the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
assigned to them, the whole being under the command of a
<i>Gerasmatch</i>, or General of the Left.</p>

<p>Near Harar I caught sight of an European white helmet,
and was met by Signor Felter, an Italian merchant, who spoke
French fluently, and very kindly offered to come with me as
far as Makunan’s house. Count Salimbeni and Signor Felter
and another gentleman formed the Italian community at Harar
at the time of my visit. The former had represented the Italian
Government, but was shortly leaving for Aden.</p>

<p>I had an interview with the Rás at his audience-house in
the centre of the town, the members of his household and
leading men of Harar being present. The audience-room or
shed was decorated with carpets, a raised dais at one end being
reserved for the Rás; an European easy-chair or two occupied
one side of the room, while the natives squatted on their heels
on the carpets. The interview was short, as is the custom on
first meeting, the visitor being supposed to be tired after his
journey. Rás Makunan asked me a few questions about Aden.
It seems that he not long ago went to Rome, where he received
a decoration. He is well informed on European subjects.</p>

<p>After this interview I was taken to the house of Alaka
Gobau Desta. He appeared to be a learned man, and his
position in England would have been something similar to that
of a college “Don,” though I think <i>Alaka</i> simply means
“chief.” He spoke excellent English, and said he was a
native of Gondar in Abyssinia. In the trimming of his hair
and beard he called to mind pictures of Spanish gentlemen
about the time of Queen Elizabeth. He was formerly in a
mission at Zanzibar, where he learnt English; and he married a
Goanese from India, since dead, who could paint in water-colours,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
and whose sketches were hanging on the walls of his house.
My friend had furnished it as far as possible in the English
style, and while there I enjoyed the comforts of an English
lodging free of cost, besides good champagne and roast beef
cooked by the wife of an Armenian who works for the
Rás. I have nothing but pleasant recollections of the very
graceful and kind hospitality of the Abyssinians at Harar, and
of Signor Felter and his charming wife.</p>

<p>My baggage not arriving on the 16th, I rode out five miles,
on a mule, along the road, to look for it. When it at last arrived
in the evening, I found my servant Ibrahim, a Somáli boy of
nineteen, had met with an accident; an angry Abyssinian,
armed with a spear, had been chasing his own servant, when
the latter ran to Ibrahim for protection; the aggressor turned
on Ibrahim and threw his spear, and trying to ward off the blow
he received the spear through the palm of his hand. It was a
very bad cut, severing an important vein, so that the hand had
been bleeding at intervals for nearly two days; and Ibrahim
arrived in a very weak state. I complained to the Rás, and
the culprit was caught and put into prison, Ibrahim receiving
the small compensation of twenty-five piastres, or about three
rupees. I told the police officials that all my servants had
orders to use their carbines, if necessary, in self-defence, and I
expressed astonishment at Ibrahim’s forbearance.</p>

<p>On 17th March I had a long interview with Rás Makunan,
when he expressed great friendship for the British; and I
conveyed to him the kind regards of General J. Jopp, C.B.,
Political Resident of Aden, and the Italian Consul-General
Cecchi, and of other officers known to him personally or by
correspondence. After the audience I met Count Salimbeni
at dinner at the house of Signor Felter.</p>

<p>On the following day I called on M. Gabriel Guigniony, a
French merchant, and Monseigneur Taurin Cahagne, officially
“Vicaire Apostolique des Gálla.” He has been many years in
the country, and probably knows more about Gálla history than
any man living.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I spent a long time with the Rás, and
gave him a photograph album of Indian scenes, and also a
tiger skin mounted on red cloth. The Rás was very much
struck with some of the photographs, which represented Indian
elephants in a “khedda”; and he asked me whether he could get
experts from India to try their hands at taming the African
elephant.</p>

<p>I showed him Sir Richard Burton’s book, <cite>First Footsteps in
East Africa</cite>, which contains such a graphic and true description
of Harar, and in which there is a sketch of the city. Gobau
Desta read Burton’s historical account of Harar to the Rás,
translating as he went along; and he said it was true in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
detail. I also showed the Rás my photo of two rhinoceros
heads. He is said to have been a keen hunter, and he sent for
my Express rifle, by Holland, and took down the number, saying
he would like to order one like it to shoot lions with, as “he
preferred English rifles for big game.”</p>

<p>I took a ride with the Italians to Jebel Hákim and round
Harar; and in the evening I dined with M. Guigniony, who
proved a charming host.</p>

<p>On the 19th I called on Count Salimbeni, and in the afternoon
had another interview with the Rás. Having come to the
city only as a private visitor, I was careful to steer clear of
politics in our conversations. But the Rás insisted on looking on
my visit as partly political, and seized the opportunity of stating
his ideas, through Gobau Desta, to an English traveller. After
the interview I took down notes, from Gobau Desta’s dictation,
concerning Abyssinian ideas, which were read to the Rás and
approved of. He particularly wished me to get them published
in England.</p>

<p>The notes referred chiefly to Abyssinian dealings with
foreigners.</p>

<p>It appears that during the last few years Abyssinia has
imported immense quantities of breech-loading firearms, and has
become, so far as the Abyssinian feudal organisation goes, a
military Power; and Abyssinians are beginning to remember
that once their country included parts of Yemen and the Soudán.
Since Theodore’s time they have been trying to gain possession
of a seaport, and now they dream of absorbing the Somáli
tribes till they reach the coast, either of the Red Sea, the Gulf
of Aden, or the Indian Ocean. They declare that they will
not be content till they have full control of one of the seaports
to which their merchandise goes, preferably Massáwa, Jibúti, or
Zeila. They hint that now the African coast-line is being
divided among the Europeans the Africans are entitled to their
share. The Abyssinians say that the expeditions which
annually advance farther into Ogádén are undertaken for the
purpose of exacting tribute, thus establishing the Abyssinian
claim to suzerainty over the Somáli tribes; and that, if possessed
of one of the northern ports, their Ogádén expeditions would
naturally cease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>However impracticable these ideas may sound to Europeans,
they seem to me interesting as showing what are Abyssinian
ambitions, and what may be the mainspring of the eastern
movement which began with the absorption of Harar, formerly
a buffer state between Abyssinia and the Somális.</p>

<p>The Abyssinians regard the European Powers with mixed
feelings. They say that they are wishing for the internal
improvement of their country according to European methods,
and promise commercial privileges to the Power which can
bring about such improvement. They are, on the other hand,
shy of the word “Protectorate,” and naturally wish to be recognised
for ever as an independent State. Abyssinians claim to
have authority as far as the confines of the Equatorial Province,
and even claim lately to have done something against the
Central African slave trade.</p>

<p>According, therefore, to my friend’s statement, Abyssinia
would appear to be the Power on whose progress the future
enlightenment of Central Africa largely depends. My own
hopes fall far short of this; for though enlightened and honourable
Abyssinians, of whom Rás Makunan may be taken as the
type, may have high ambitions, yet the ruck of the people,
from the specimens of soldiers whom I saw at Harar, appear
to be certainly no better than the nomad Somális, except
in their possession of rifles.</p>

<p>The Rás was unwell on the 19th, and could not see any one.
I received visits from the Archbishop and M. Guigniony. The
medium of conversation with Europeans in Harar was French;
curiously enough, the only person who could speak English
fluently was Gobau Desta, the Abyssinian who generally acted
as my interpreter with the Rás.</p>

<p>On 20th March I received a visit from Count Salimbeni,
and after dinner I had a long farewell interview with the Rás,
when he gave me the following presents:—</p>

<p>(1) The Rás’s photograph.</p>

<p>(2) The Rás’s own drinking-cup.</p>

<p>(3) Three other cups of buffalo and rhinoceros horn.</p>

<p>(4) A buffalo-hide officer’s shield decorated with silver.</p>

<p>(5) Two Abyssinian spears.</p>

<p>(6) A gray riding mule and embroidered equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>The mule, which was a strong, pretty, and very useful animal,
was sent to Desta’s house for me, and afterwards accompanied
me twice to the Webbe.</p>

<p>The interview of the 20th March, which was held at 8 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>
by lamplight, was the last I had with the Rás in his house. As
it was a farewell visit, he had sent for his household and elders,
and I amused them by showing the various English positions in
use with the match rifle, several attempting them on the floor
of the audience-room.</p>

<p>The Rás again asked me about taming elephants, a subject
which appears to have impressed him. The presents for me
were laid out in front of us all amid a buzz of admiration from
the courtiers. I thanked Makunan for them, and said that it
would crown his kindness if he would give me a letter to his
frontier generals providing for my safe passage through districts
occupied by his soldiers. I had the greatest difficulty in getting
this out of him, as his suspicious officers strongly advised him
to put nothing on paper. By insisting, however, I at last got
the letter.</p>

<p>On 21st March I called on Wandi, chief of police, as he
had sent a message to say he was sick and unable to come to
me. I found him in bed with fever.</p>

<p>I then had the presentation mule dressed in all its state
satin embroidery, and, myself clothed in a canvas shooting hat,
<i>kháki</i> drill coat, with a high starched collar, drill breeches, and
brown leather Elcho boots, I sat on the mule and went to meet
the Rás, who was leaving for Jarso on an inspection. Riding
half a mile down a path, I came on the usual procession of
soldiers, and found the Rás at its head. We dismounted and
bade each other a final good-bye, the Rás going off to Jarso and
I returning to Harar.</p>

<p>In the evening I rode out with the Italians to Jebel Hákim,
and visited some wonderful caves in the limestone rock, which
have their openings in the top of the hill. They are formed
by rain-water collecting in natural pans on the open grass-covered
summit and sinking into the hill, chemically eroding
the limestone, and producing immense well-like chasms. This
water finds its way to the surface round the base of the hill,
where good water is always to be found at every mile or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
so. This hill overlooks Harar from a distance of about a
mile.</p>

<p>On 22nd March I called on an Armenian and his wife
who are employed by the Rás; and after saying good-bye to
the Europeans I took the road to Feyambiro, with my servants
and a dozen soldiers who had been told off as porters to carry
my baggage. Felter and Guigniony came some distance to see
me off, the latter riding a beautiful little Abyssinian horse.
These horses are very pretty and graceful, but restive; in shape
they resemble the Arab, and are about fourteen hands high.</p>

<p>My wounded servant was so weak that he had to ride on
a mule. Count Salimbeni had, however, by careful treatment,
stopped the bleeding and put him in a fair way to recovery,
though he was still very weak.</p>

<p>I reached Feyambiro on the same day, being entertained
by the <i>Shúm</i>, Basha-Gisáo; and while encamped here I had a
curious adventure, probably unique in the annals of camping
out. I was, as usual, sleeping on the ground inside a Cabul
tent. After nightfall I was awakened by a disturbance going
on outside, men running to and fro through the camp and
shouting. I ran out and could see nothing at first, it being
a dark night, and the only forms visible were those of my
men and camels, which loomed out against the sky, and they
seemed to be all rushing about wildly. At my tent door I
found Adan Yusuf, who said a Bertiri bull had gone mad and had
broken loose from a cattle-shed in the village, and was charging
about through my camp knocking over everything in its way.
It had already knocked over two men. Presently the bull rushed
past me; I could just make it out, but soon lost its form among
those of the running men. I jumped out of the way, and in
another charge, having made a circle among the camels, he came
straight back full tilt into my tent! All the men rushed for the
tent, and I followed, and heard cries inside. Coming up, I saw
an Abyssinian soldier run at the tent door with a drawn sword,
and then there was a confused jumble of shouting men and the
bellowing of the bull. Some one at last produced a torch, and a
curious scene was disclosed. The bull had charged through my
tent and entangled his head in the closed back of it, which had
been firmly laced up; and Adan Yusuf had run in and caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
him by the horns. The Abyssinian soldiers had then hamstrung
him with sabre cuts and had cut his throat, so that he had fallen
upon my bedding, a pool of clotted blood from his throat standing
an inch high, covering my pillow, blankets, and all my kit.
Taking hold of his hind leg they had then dragged him out by
the front door, carrying the blankets along with him.</p>

<p>The curious part of the adventure was that with all this
disturbance of my kit, two spring candlesticks with their glass
globes, which had been rolling about under the bull’s feet, were
uninjured!</p>

<p>On the 23rd I marched to Hado, and was again the guest
of Abadigal. We then marched to Jig-Jiga, where I rejoined
part of my caravan which I had left behind during the Harar
visit. After waiting here for two days to reorganise my expedition,
I started for the Jerer Valley on my way to Ogádén
and the Webbe.</p>

<p>I left Jig-Jiga for the Jerer Valley and Ogádén country on
26th March 1893, with the whole of my caravan, consisting of
three fast Aden camels, thirty-three baggage camels, and the
mule which Rás Makunan had given me; and I had still my
following of the twenty-one faithful Somális armed with Snider
carbines. I had finished my visit to Harar; and now, armed
with Rás Makunan’s passport, I was free to strike across Somáliland
to the Webbe Shabéleh river, four hundred miles inland,
and to shoot big game unmolested by Abyssinian soldiers, and,
what was more important, in hunting-grounds hitherto untouched
by Europeans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>We should have started early on the 26th, but had great difficulty
in getting guides to the Rer Ali tribe, because the Bertiri
at Jig-Jiga were afraid that if they assisted us they would be
made to regret it by the Abyssinians. But on my showing
Makunan’s passport to the <i>Shúm</i> in charge of the stockade, he
promised the timid people that they would receive no harm on
my account, and I marched with two Bertiri guides at 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span></p>

<p>We threaded our way through grass plains and jungle to
Kuredelli in the Jerer Valley, which runs south-east towards the
Webbe Shabéleh; and on reaching this place in the evening, I
was delighted to find a pool of water in the rocky bed of the
river, the edges of which were literally covered with tracks of
large game. Among other animals a lion and a rhinoceros
had come to drink on the preceding night.</p>

<p>The river-bed was very rocky, and sunk some fifteen feet
below the level of the surrounding plain, which was covered
with dense mimósa jungle. Half a mile up the channel, to the
west of the pool, was my camp, pitched under some large shady
trees in a glade of good but rather dry grass. There had been
a very severe drought during the <i>Jilál</i> season, as is usual, but
the drought this year had been particularly severe because the
previous <i>Dair</i> or light winter rains had failed, so that Kuredelli
was one of the few pools of surface water left in the whole of
this elevated country, and there was not a drop to be got for
many miles round. The water was covered with duckweed,
and was of a bright emerald green colour throughout, and had
almost the consistency of pea-soup; but, curiously enough, it
was perfectly sweet and good, and we drank it for a week
without its doing us any harm.</p>

<p>The pool was not more than fifteen yards long by five wide,
its longer axis pointing up and down the river-bed; and on the
northern side it was overhung by a steep scarp of rock some
five feet high, where the limestone had been undermined by the
swirl of the river when in flood. Above the rocky scarp were
thick thorn-trees, whose branches overhung the river-bed, and
under these branches, on the edge of the scarp and overlooking
the pool, I constructed a small bower, bearing a rugged resemblance
to a box at an European theatre. Nothing could spring
on us from behind because of the interlaced branches of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
trees which made our roof, while the floor was a smooth slab
of limestone rock, and in front and at the top of the small
precipice were piled thorn branches breast-high, so that I could
fire over them. The front of the box was otherwise quite open,
and the field of view embraced two right angles.</p>

<p>We made this retreat in an hour, and I took up a position,
as night fell, in the bower with my two hunters Géli and Hassan.
We carried my three rifles and spare ammunition, and four
more men brought my bedding, blankets for my hunters, a
lamp, matches, and my water-bottle full of coffee. We did not
forget a waterproof sheet each, to be used in case of rain.</p>

<p>My four carriers had also brought a donkey with them,
which they tied up to a heavy block on a flat slab of limestone
which shelved down into the pool on the farther side, for we
hoped thereby to attract lions; the carriers then went off to
camp, and left us squatting silently in our shelter.</p>

<p>I describe our arrangements thus in detail because I have
in this way sat out for game on scores of nights, and one description
will serve for all. There is one thing I never omit, when
about to spend a night in one of these jungle shelters, or when
marching by night, and that is to decorate the centre rib of
each of my game rifles with a long strip of snow-white foolscap
paper, to assist the aim; for, however good the moonlight may
be, it is impossible to see the tiny ivory foresight at night.</p>

<p>I sat over this pool on five successive nights. On the first
night three hyænas came, but no lion or rhinoceros. The
hyænas invariably came silently down to drink till they saw
the living bait, and then at once took fright and galloped away;
on the succeeding four nights I therefore dispensed with the
bait. For two hours, after the moon rose, several wild ducks
kept us interested by playing about in the water and quacking,
quite unaware of our presence. I then went to sleep. We
saw nothing on the next evening, and I slept all night in the
shelter, waking up covered with dew at daylight, and returning,
rather stiff with the exposure, to camp.</p>

<p>On the third night I was roused by Géli, whose eyes I
could see full of excitement in the semi-darkness, and still crouching
below my screen of branches, I could hear the wallowing of
some heavy animal in the soft mud at the water’s edge. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
were all on the alert as I gently felt for the four-bore which
Hassan shoved into my hands. On cautiously poking my
head above the screen, I saw the great form of a rhinoceros
standing motionless as a carved sphinx in the moonlight,
casting a deep black shadow upon the white rock. I stood
erect, and raising my arms placed the butt of the four-bore
to my shoulder. The action was seen, for the beast trotted
forward a few steps, and then galloped across the slabs of rock
for a path which ascended the bank on my side of the river,
and led behind my shelter. I fired at his shoulder hurriedly,
and, sad to say, heard no answering “tell,” showing that the
bullet had not struck; and before I could look under the
smoke I heard the rhinoceros, with a succession of snorts,
gallop up the bank and trot behind my shelter; then all sound
ceased but the animal’s breathing, which we could hear distinctly,
close to and above us, only separated from us by the stout
interlaced branches of the back of our “box.” We stood with
rifles at the “charge,” ready to fire and throw ourselves down
into the river-bed should his ugly head and horns protrude into
our bower. He did not keep us in suspense long, but after
listening for more than a minute, he trotted off, the sound of
his footsteps getting fainter on the still night air, and eventually
dying away.</p>

<p class="caption">The Pool at Kuredelli</p>
</div>

<p>On the 29th I returned to camp at sunrise, and swallowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
a cup of hot coffee, which my cook, having heard the shot and
divined its purport, had prepared for me, I took up the tracks
with two camelmen, letting Géli and Hassan sleep in camp.
We followed them till noon, the sun being fearfully hot; and
either through the unskilfulness of my trackers, or through the
absence of blood on the track causing me to lose heart in the
fearful <i>Jilál</i> heat, we had to leave the trail at a stony ravine;
and in the afternoon we returned to camp, tired out.</p>

<p>Swallowing some food, I took a short sleep; and towards
sunset I went out again with Géli and Hassan into the bush to
the west. Suddenly Géli pointed, and saying “<i>Libah!</i>” (Lions!)
started to run across an open plain of bare red earth; and
there, three hundred yards away, were a lioness and young lion
reclining by the stem of a tall, shady thorn-tree, looking at us.
I had been searching for rhinoceros, and was burdened with
my double four-bore rifle, weighing twenty-two pounds, so when
Géli started running he at once got ahead of me, and Hassan,
carried away by the excitement, followed suit. The brutes, seeing
three men running across the plain towards them, stood up,
stretched themselves, and giving a toss of the tail and a savage
growl, they cantered easily away across the sun-baked earth
in full view, and plunged into the low mimósa jungle beyond.
I ran up to Géli very much put out, and snatching my ·577
Express from his hand, and giving him the heavy rifle to retard
his pace, I plunged into the bush and grass after the lions, but
the grass was so thick and dry that I soon overran the almost
invisible tracks, and though we made several tries back on to
the red soil, we eventually lost them, and I returned to camp
disgusted with the afternoon’s entertainment, and lectured my
men in rather a wrathful way on the folly of out-running me.</p>

<p>On the next night we all awoke at the same time, while
the moon was still low, having been roused by the disturbance
of the pool; and we made so much noise in throwing off our
blankets and getting ready that a rhinoceros, which had
come down to the pool, heard us and made off. I fired the
four-bore, and my bullet caught it in the shoulder, sending it
galloping up the bank, snorting as before. On this night the
beast waited, listening close behind my hiding-place for nearly
ten minutes; then all sounds ceased, and I thought it must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
dead. It had, however, slipped quietly away; so there was
nothing to be done, and we went to sleep. When we woke
again the moon was well up, it being about two o’clock in the
morning. Géli had awakened me, having seen something pass
among the bushes on our bank of the river, between my hiding-place
and the camp.</p>

<p>The moon was throwing a fine light on the flat limestone
slabs which composed the floor of the river-bed, and as we
gazed in the direction in which Géli pointed, rubbing our eyes,
we saw against the white background three large animals walk
out from the bushes into the open near the pool; one glance
told us that they were three full-grown lionesses.</p>

<p>They walked quietly across till they reached the place
where the rhinoceros had been standing when first hit; and
then they stood together snuffing at the blood, which we found
next day in quantities on the rocks. I could count their twelve
short and stout legs showing in silhouette against the white
floor of the river-bed, as they stood motionless, heads bent over
the fresh blood, appearing to consult together. I reserved my
fire, as I knew they had come to drink, and would give me a
better chance, nearer to my shelter, later on. The lionesses
then walked slowly across the river-bed in single file, and up a
path which ascended the opposite bank, and then they disappeared.
But they had not really gone, for from time to time
during the next half-hour I could see their round heads raised
in silhouette against the sky-line, above the black outline of
the bank; they too were watching the pool for game!</p>

<p>I must have dozed off to sleep again, for the moon had
swung over a good deal towards the western horizon, when I
noticed Géli squatting in a listening attitude, and I heard the
steady lapping as of an animal drinking. Géli whispered,
“Now, be ready, Sahib!” and slowly raising my head above
my screen, pushing the muzzle of my Express forward at the
same time, I saw over the barrels the body of a lioness extended,
hind quarters flattened against the rock, shoulders high and
head down towards me, lapping the water on the farther side
of the pool. I did not wait long, but glancing between her
upraised shoulders and lowering the muzzle till the white paper
on the rib between the barrels had disappeared, I pulled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
trigger. My bower was full of smoke, and I ducked under the
screen as the report of the rifle was instantly followed by a
roar and a splash, and jumping to our feet we just saw the
lioness, after having sprung into the centre of the pool to get
at us, in the act of raising her dripping body out of the water.
No doubt the cold douche had damped her enthusiasm, and she
had turned back. Before I could take a sight down the barrels
she rushed off across the river-bed, pulling up in the sombre
belt of bush on the farther side to roll about and growl. There
was nothing more to be done, and though my Somális hinted
that she might be hunted by moonlight, I, mindful of our Gebili
leopard, preferred to wait till morning before following a
wounded lioness into those dark-looking evergreen bushes which
cast such uncertain shadows.</p>

<p>I woke up again at sunrise, and without going to camp or
tasting food, I at once took up the tracks of the lioness. Her
line of retreat was sprinkled with blood. We drew the bushes
under the opposite bank very carefully, and then began to
ascend the bank by the path, the wind being with us, blowing
towards the south. Before we had reached the top we heard
several loud roars a few hundred yards beyond, and as we
appeared on the higher level the roars were redoubled, issuing
from very low, gray, leafless mimósa bush. We followed,
keeping to the tracks, and at last saw, eighty yards away, the
head of the lioness, held vertically, regarding us intently from
the partial concealment of a tuft of grass on the farther side of
a glade. She seemed to be on the eve of charging, the black
point of her tail twitching nervously behind her head, which
bore a very nasty expression. I fired, but missed the small
mark. There were now eight of us, some of my men who
had come to take away the blankets and other things from the
bower having joined us. We stood in an irregular line, fully
expecting a charge, and I fired another standing shot at the
small, wicked-looking head, my bullet going harmlessly through
the grass. Looking under the smoke quickly, I saw her still
in the same place, but she was in a greater rage than ever,
and kept up a steady low growling. This was my first
experience of one of these animals after having been so badly
mauled by one, and the situation was becoming therefore highly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
exciting. I now sat down, and resting both my elbows on my
knees, took a very careful shot at her. Her head dropped,
showing I had killed her, and we walked up to where she lay.</p>

<p>My first bullet, fired at her while drinking at the water, had
struck her in the left forearm and shattered it, accounting for
her not having charged; and my last bullet had touched her
left cheek; and then, entering perpendicularly, it had expanded
and carried away half the brain pan. She was a very fine
lioness, the skin being in splendid condition. I told Géli and
Hassan to stay and skin her, as I had now to follow up the
rhinoceros wounded in the early part of the night. But they
begged to be allowed to go with me, so I left two camelmen to
do the skinning of the lioness.</p>

<p>Going to camp and hastily swallowing some coffee, we returned
to the scene of last night’s adventure, and found the
tracks of the rhinoceros plentifully sprinkled with blood. One
of the legs appeared to be injured at the shoulder, as the trail
where the foot had been dragged along the ground was plainly
visible.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock we entered very dense mimósa bushes, of
a peculiarly thorny kind, called <i>billeil</i>, and under one of these
we saw the rhinoceros, a large cow. She saw us first, however,
and charged, getting a pair of four-bore bullets in the chest at
rather long range as she came on. Hassan handed me my eight-bore,
and I carefully aimed at her shoulder as she picked herself
up and came on again; but there was nothing in the rifle, and
I had to bolt off to the right, leaving her to select a victim from
among my men, who, more active than I, were dancing about
the bush yelling out directions to me to fire! When I had got
in a couple of cartridges I fired at her right and left; and the
second shot, striking obliquely through her shoulders from the
front, brought her to the ground, and she died, still retaining
the kneeling position after life had left her. Going up to her,
I found that last night’s ball from the four-bore had injured
her shoulder. She had gone several miles, had taken three four-bore
and two eight-bore bullets, and had died game, having
chosen the worst kind of bush she could pick out for the final
scene. I photographed her as she lay kneeling, leafless thorny
mimósas spreading their branches all round her, in this strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
defensive position which she had chosen as her last retreat, the
sun casting a shadow in every wrinkle of her thick hide.</p>

<p>Returning to camp, I laid the rhino and lioness heads
side by side and photographed them, making a curious and
unique picture to remind me of a good morning’s sport before
breakfast.</p>

<p>While arranging the bower at midday for our last and
fifth vigil, a large spotted hyæna came to drink; and not wishing
to disturb lions by firing a rifle, I ran after him, followed by
my Somális. We had no weapons but unloaded Sniders, and
my knife and double pistol. Running hard to cut him off, I
was ahead of the men as he gained the slope of the river bank,
and fired both barrels of my pistol, missing him with one barrel
and knocking him over with the second. He picked himself up
and disappeared over the top of the bank, taking the same path
which the wounded lioness had followed in the morning; we,
however, gained on him, as he was now crippled by my bullet,
and he hid under a low mimósa. The men came up in front,
and one of them shoved the butt of a Snider into his face, under
the low-spreading branches. He seized hold of this and chewed
at it vigorously, while I was able to get round unobserved in
his rear, and creeping behind the stems of the bush, to drive
my knife mercifully into his ribs. Every hyæna destroyed
means a large number of sheep and goats to the good.</p>

<p>At about three o’clock on the afternoon of this day, 20th
March, my camp being still at Kuredelli, a large force, consisting
of two or three hundred men, mostly naked, and all armed with
shield and spear, or bow and quiver, issued from the bush
north of camp and came running past, going due south. As
they passed the camp they scarcely answered our hurried questions,
but my men gathered that they were Abbasgúl Somális
belonging to some karias a few miles to the south of us, and
that their cattle had just been raided by the Habr-Awal and
driven north through the bush of the Haud. My men laughed
at them for going naked, but they said they had no time to
bother about their tobes; they had come light for running, and
only wanted their cattle back. Party after party passed us,
and men singly and in couples, all in the same state of nakedness
and breathless excitement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>I sat up, as on the four previous nights, in my favourite
bower, and at about 1 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> these people returned with a large
mob of cattle which they had recovered and were bringing
home. They were talking excitedly as they approached the
pool. We heard one man ask, “Where were you wounded?”
and another answer, “Oh, in the leg, but it isn’t bad.”</p>

<p>There were recriminations going on between two parties.
The party which first came up was met by another party
coming from the north-west, which appeared to have lost the
enemy, for the first arrivals called out, “Why were you not at
the fight; why did you run away?” and were answered, “Oh,
we lost the way.” I wanted to challenge, but Géli and Hassan
advised silence. This I would not agree to, for I thought that
the men, nervous and excited as they were, if they did discover
our presence accidentally by a rustle or otherwise, might suspect
a hidden enemy and send a flight of arrows into my hiding-place
to make sure. So I called out “<i>Kumá?</i>” (Who are you?), and
as they halted Géli said it was a “<i>Sirkal</i>” (<i>i.e.</i> Government
man or Englishman) with his two hunters, sitting up for game;
and that they must look sharp and drink, and begone.</p>

<p>The men came down to drink, saying they would bring
the cattle to water in the morning, and they further asked to
be allowed to bivouac near my camp for additional security in
case they should be followed. They said, “It is all right; we
know you are an Englishman, and that you are here for no
harm. The country is yours, we are your subjects; we beg to
be excused for having killed some of the Habr Awal, for we
know the Government dislikes bloodshed. But without our
cattle we should have died.” Kuredelli is two hundred miles
from the coast, and this is only one instance in many showing
that British influence is recognised not only on the Somáli
coast itself, but also in the distant interior. And no Englishman
had been in this neighbourhood till my brother and I
explored it a few months before.</p>

<p>These two or three hundred men had followed the tracks
of their cattle, and between three o’clock on the previous afternoon
and ten o’clock in the morning they had reached the open
plains to the north; the distance covered in the ten hours could
not have been less than thirty-five miles, with many delays inseparable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
from fighting and driving cattle over rough ground at
night. They had found the Habr Awal, about half their strength,
in the <i>ban</i> or open grass plains, and had at once attacked them
by the light of the moon, killing two of the enemy and losing a
man themselves, killed by a poisoned arrow. The enemy then fled.</p>

<p>The cattle were driven past with clouds of dust and a
clamour of excited voices, and then they all disappeared in the
distance, and I heard my sentry challenge them as they drew
up at my camp half a mile away, and after another half-hour
of chatter they gradually settled down to rest. I had never
met this clan of the Abbasgúl before. The men flocked to
camp next day from their karias in great numbers, and seeing
the trophies of the lioness and rhinoceros lying on the grass
outside my tent door, they said, “The Abyssinians can’t do
that; their guns are small, and are only good for killing women
and children and old men with: you English are our friends,
and all the Ogádén tribes look to you, our masters, for protection
against Abyssinia.”</p>

<p>On 31st March we made two marches to Girbi, seventeen
miles eastward along the Jerer Valley, and the next day we
made a short march in a heavy storm of rain, the burst of the
south-west monsoon; and the red clay became so sticky that
we were obliged to halt in the thick bush. When things were
a little dry again, I went out towards sunset into the level thorn
forest to look for oryx. We had gone about a mile from camp
when we saw a large rhinoceros bull trotting along under the
trees a quarter of a mile away, having evidently winded us.
We ran at an angle to cut him off, but he changed his pace
to a heavy gallop, crashing through the thick parts of the
jungle as if they had been clumps of grass. We followed in
his wake, but failed to get within shot, for a rhinoceros should
not be fired at from a greater distance than about eighty yards;
and so we settled steadily down to his tracks, hoping to catch
him up before nightfall. He retreated into very thick bush,
and as he was going with the wind he twice winded us, and
made off when we were close up, but the jungle being thick
we could not see him. At last, night coming on, we left him
and returned to camp after dark, very tired and disappointed.</p>

<p>Next day, the 2nd April, we marched on. As we advanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
down the Jerer Valley by rapid stages we passed suddenly from
country dried up by continued drought into a world of green
grass and jungle, with an overcast sky, the effect of the bursting
of the south-west monsoon over the lower Jerer Valley some
ten days before. Nothing can be more pleasant in Somáliland
than this sudden change: the camels march better owing
to fresh fodder; the air is rendered cool, allowing one to travel
during any hour of the day; and the thorn-trees give out a
strong perfume.</p>

<p>At 5.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> on 3rd April we camped in the bush, without
water, at Manjo-adéyu. Before camping I fired at a buck
Waller’s gazelle, wounding it badly, but it did not drop at once,
and we had to follow it up. I was rather fagged, having done
a long march on foot owing to my camel being lame; and sending
on ahead my Midgán hunter, Hassan, I followed the tracks
with Géli at a leisurely pace. We at last came to the buck,
lying dead, and Hassan standing over it. He reported that
he had just seen the buck pulled down before his eyes by a
large panther, which had caught sight of him after springing
upon it, and had cantered away through the forest.</p>

<p>Sending the three camels and mule out of sight into some
thick bush to the south, and ordering a camelman to overtake
the caravan and have the camp pitched, I sat with Géli and
Hassan by the stem of a tree on a bare patch of ground some
fifteen yards from the body of the buck, the sun shining
horizontally from behind our backs.</p>

<p>We waited for half an hour, then Géli pointed to the north-east,
and the panther came gliding silently through the underbrush,
coming straight for the body of the buck. While he was
yet one hundred and fifty yards off I saw his beautifully spotted
skin and bullet head, and marking his course I chose a bush
eighty yards away, aligning the sight so as to be ready to fire
when he should come out into the open beyond it on our side.
I held the ivory foresight over this spot, and as he passed the
bush and his head and shoulders appeared, I pulled, a satisfactory
thud answering the ring of the rifle; and in the stillness following
the shot I saw a tail violently agitated above the grass.
Slipping in a fresh cartridge to replace the empty case, I walked
up and found the panther dead, shot through the neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>I laid his body by the side of that of the Walleri, and
photographed the pair, cutting down some thorn-trees, whose
branches threw long shadows over the picture; then calling for
the camels and loading up the bodies, we followed the tracks
of the caravan, and found camp pitched two miles from the
scene of this incident.</p>

<p>We made two marches to Haljíd, where, hearing by night
the croaking of thousands of bull-frogs, we discovered a considerable
body of water, in the form of a pool half a mile long,
occupying the river channel in the centre of the Jerer Valley.
There were plenty of rhino, oryx, and lesser koodoo tracks here.
I remained halted all day on 5th April, shooting three oryx
out of a herd, a welcome supply of meat; and on the evening
of the 6th we marched to Túli. We lost our way while hunting
at some distance from the caravan, and only found the new
camp at midnight after a lot of signal shots had been fired.
I remained in this neighbourhood for four days to hunt, as
rhinoceroses were very numerous here, coming to drink at night
at the pools in the centre of the valley, and going away great
distances in every direction to hide in the thickest mimósa
forests by day. The best way to find them is to visit the
pools in the early morning, and follow any fresh tracks of the
night before. In this way, after four or five hours’ tracking,
one is likely to come upon them feeding about, or, if after
eleven o’clock, lying under a shady bush asleep.</p>

<p>On 7th April my men found a dozen young ostriches in
the thick jungle near Túli Hill. They were pretty little birds
with soft yellow and black down for plumage, and beady black
eyes, and stood a foot high, on sturdy yellow legs. I did all I
could to get the parent cock bird: first, by following behind a
camel, and then by sitting till midday in ambush near the nest;
but all my attempts were unavailing. We had these young
birds for ten days or more in our camp, carrying them, when
marching, in hutches made of empty beer boxes, on camel-back;
and they became very tame, but eventually, one by one, they
all died.</p>

<p>On the 8th April I rose before dawn with Géli, Hassan,
my camelman Abokr, my syce Daura, and a guide. We took
one camel with us, and holding due west we entered the thick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
mimósa forest which is called Gol Wiyileh,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> or the “Valley of
Rhinoceroses”; and after going four miles, when we had gained
the centre of the valley, in dense bush, we came to fresh tracks
of three of these animals, which had passed late in the night,
making for the south-west from the pools of the Jerer Valley.
They led us through many miles of thick bush, but the tracking
was easy owing to there being three of them together; and at
one o’clock in the afternoon, after having left camp for seven
hours, we came on them standing together in the dense shade
of a very thick clump of umbrella mimósas. There was a full-grown
bull, accompanied by a large cow and a bull calf, the
big bull having a very fine front horn.</p>

<p>I at once sank to a sitting position, holding my eight-bore,
while Hassan laid down the heavy four-bore on the grass beside
me to be used in case of a charge. The big bull was eighty
yards away, and I fired for his ear, and he dropped dead, remaining
in a sitting posture and looking as if carved in stone.
I fired the other barrel at one of the others, which turned out to
be the large calf, and the game made off. We decided not to
follow them up at once, but to give them time to get over their
fright, as they had never actually seen us. So I took a careful
photograph of the big bull, and after taking off the head and
some shields, I sent Daura back to Túli on Rás Makunan’s
mule, telling him to bring the camp to a deserted zeríba which
we had noticed while tracking, not far from where the bull lay.</p>

<p>Leaving Abokr, the guide, and a camel by the body, I took
my two hunters, Géli and Hassan, and followed the track of
the remaining rhinoceroses, which was plentifully sprinkled with
blood. I came upon them in very thick cover, standing forty
yards away, heads towards us; and at once sitting down with the
rifle I was carrying, which happened to be the heavy four-bore,
I fired at the nearest head through a maze of interlaced branches.</p>

<p>The four-bore pushed me over on my back, and the rhinos
charged us at once with a volley of puffing sounds, crashing
through the jungle at full gallop. As I rose to my feet the first,
the young bull, passed me, and took after the two men; the big
cow followed, passing me at a distance of only ten yards, and I
threw the rifle to my shoulder and knocked her over, making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
her turn a somersault with her four legs fighting the air! Giving
a hurried look at her, and seeing her lying still, I rushed on
after the other; but although he had been twice hit I lost him,
after another half mile, in some high <i>durr</i> grass. Returning to
the big cow, I found her still unconscious, but gently breathing,
lying on her side, and I finished her with a shot through the
head. The young bull, I think, must have eventually recovered,
as the two wounds in the head, having missed the brain, would
not have injured him mortally. Leaving the men to prepare
the heads and shields for conveyance to camp, I walked to the
deserted zeríba and found the camp pitched inside, and dinner
ready; and two hours later, at sunset, the trophies came in,
Daura chanting a hunting song.</p>

<p>We spent the morning of the 9th preparing the trophies,
and in the evening marched back to Túli. I shot an oryx with
good horns, and a Walleri buck, and next day we made another
march of ten miles.</p>

<p>We reached the grazing grounds of the Sheikh Ash Ogádén,
a very friendly set of people, whom I had met before. The
men, who were with the camels grazing in the outer pastures,
ran away on first seeing us, mistaking my men, who carried
Snider rifles, for Abyssinian raiders. But soon they all rushed
back, shouting and crowding round my riding camel, and raising
scores of hands for me to shake.</p>

<p>Getting into the thick of the tribe later on, we camped
among their karias, beside a tall red ant-hill; and while camp
was being pitched, wishing to draw off the crowds of people from
worrying my men at their work, I withdrew to a distance of a
couple of hundred yards and, under the shade of an <i>Adad</i> thorn-tree,
exhibited coloured prints from the <cite>Graphic</cite> Christmas
numbers, and a book representing the different varieties of British
soldier. The men, women, and children pressed round me in a
dense mass, remarking, “You are not like the Amhára;<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> we
are not afraid of you; you don’t mean any harm.” They were
particularly delighted with some old Zoological Society’s <cite>Proceedings</cite>
which contained coloured illustrations of a Waller’s
gazelle and of a Somáli wild ass; and they said, “Now we have
seen that the English can do everything!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>I had a serious difficulty here. One of the Bulhár men,
having quarrelled with Adan Yusuf, my caravan leader, decided
to leave me; and as is the custom, seven more coast men,
drawn from the same tribe, although bearing no malice, joined
their fellow-tribesman as a matter of principle. I called for
volunteers from the Sheikh Ash tribe; and about twenty at once
offering themselves, my own followers, seeing I was independent,
returned to obedience. I dismissed the two ringleaders with
ten days’ rations and their back pay, and wished them a safe
return to Berbera. It is a good thing when making up a
caravan not to draw too many men from one tribe.</p>

<p>I gave several Korans and prayer-chaplets to the mullahs
here, and they were received with real pleasure. The mullahs
are the traveller’s best friends in Ogádén; they are intelligent,
have great social influence, and are particularly useful in giving
introductions, passing a traveller on from tribe to tribe. The
more intelligent among them can write in Arabic. From these
mullahs I heard that at Durhi, in the Malingúr tribe, on one of
the roads to Imé on the Webbe, I was certain to come upon
Grevy’s zebra, which had not yet, I believe, been shot by
Europeans; so I determined to go there.</p>

<p>On the 13th I broke up my camp at Yoghon among the
Sheikh Ash karias, and marched along the bed of a torrent,
deep cut in the red earth, to a pool called Garba-aleh.</p>

<p>Before striking camp at earliest dawn, just as Suleiman the
cook, whom I always told the sentry to awaken before the bulk
of my followers, was beginning to prepare my coffee, a leopard
jumped into the middle of the camp to seize my best milch
goat, which was reclining under the lee of a pile of camel-mats;
but Makunan’s mule, by braying at the brute, aroused the
whole camp. The Somális rushed unarmed at the leopard,
while I dived quietly under my bed and drew out my coat,
which had cartridges in the pockets, and a rifle; but of course
by the time all this was ready the leopard had gone!</p>

<p>Approaching the water at Garba-aleh I saw three hyænas
making off through the thorn forest; and I sent a Martini-Henry
picket through one of them, by which I hoped to secure
his eventual death, and so save some Malingúr sheep.</p>

<p>I met an old man called Mader Ádan, the first Malingúr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
I had seen, and he greeted me cheerily, and told me to expect
lions and rhinoceroses in plenty at Eil-ki-Gabro, a march or two
ahead. He said his own karia had been driven from the district
by the former. This was joyful news.</p>

<p>The Garba-aleh pool, about twenty yards in diameter, in
the bed of a deeply-cut sand-river, looked promising for lying in
ambush, so I constructed a shelter on the principle of that
which had been so successful at Kuredelli, the back of the
bower being an overhanging wall of earth fifteen feet high. As
it had been a hot day even for the <i>Kalíl</i> season, and likely
to bring game early to water, I occupied my ambush at about
five o’clock, and we sat quiet.</p>

<p class="caption">A Herd of Oryx</p>
</div>

<p>While it was yet light a large spotted hyæna came warily
up to the water, looking round to right and left, and starting
nervously at every sound, and I shot him through the brain as
he drank, his body dropping into the water. At dusk a beautiful
male leopard walked down to the pool, and I fired, hitting
him through the lungs; he stumbled away and fell in a ravine
a few yards on the farther side of the pool. Fearing hyænas
would come and spoil the skin, we got a lantern and went to
look for him, and walking up cautiously to the ravine we found
him lying dead. With my whistle I called up three men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
bearing the leopard to camp, we skinned him by the camp
fire. I then returned to the pool and missed a hyæna, and
finding it was too dark to shoot, and that mosquitoes, which
breed in these stagnant pools, were rather bad round our bower,
making it impossible to keep still, I went to camp and turned
in for the night.</p>

<p>On 14th April we marched to Eil-ki-Gabro, and found lion
and rhino tracks at the water. Making another shelter I sat
up on the chance of a shot, but saw nothing.</p>

<p>Disappointed here, the next day we went to Náno, a small
valley in the mountains, where we found plenty of game, the kinds
seen being koodoo, lesser koodoo, oryx, Sœmmering’s and Waller’s
gazelles, and a rhinoceros. I had a long hunt after the last, as
the men were pitching camp, but going hard for two or three miles
over very broken thorny country he fairly beat us, and we gave
him up and returned to camp, knocked up by the hot sun.</p>

<p>We made an evening march to a river-bed, choked with
dense, evergreen jungle and some high trees hung with rope-like
creepers, and our guide, going into the thickest of this to look
for water, started a cow rhinoceros and calf. He came running
back to us shouting, “<i>Wiyil, wiyil</i>” (Rhinoceros), while the mother
and her young one galloped out on the farther side of the jungle
with a crash, and took away over the low stony hills. By the
time I could get possession of my big rifle and run after them,
they were seen quite a thousand yards away disappearing round
the shoulder of a rocky, thorn-covered hill, and running up to
this spot a few minutes later I was unable to sight them again,
and the ground being unsuitable for tracking we lost them.</p>

<p>We made three more marches to Durhi; and I came upon
the tracks of a herd of zebras an hour before pitching camp
there on the 17th. Here we found several karias of the
Malingúr Ogádén. The first people we saw were a group
standing round an open grave; and on inquiring we found
they were burying the body of a young woman who had been
torn out of a hut from among several of her sleeping friends on
the night before by a man-eating lion.</p>

<p>These people had never seen one of my countrymen before,
but on hearing I was <i>Ingrés</i> (English) they ran at me, calling
out that I must shoot the lion and drive away the Amhára. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
was led some miles into the bush to the west, where I found a
party of the Malingúr following the lion, armed with their
spears; but the tracks led on to very stony and thorny hills,
and my guides being either unable or unwilling to keep them,
we gave it up and I returned to camp, which had been pitched
between two large karias. We had a severe thunder-storm at
night; a lion walked round my tent during the storm, as we
saw next morning by his tracks in the mud only five yards
away from the head of my bed!</p>

<p>On the following day I went out and shot two Grevy’s
zebras, the meat of which my men finished. We also saw
tracks of another lion.</p>

<p>Next day I shot another zebra, the flesh of which I gave
to the Malingúr. I tied up a camel at night, intending to sit
out for a lion, but owing to the rain I had to abandon the idea;
and when we went to the camel at midnight, we found it had
been killed by hyænas, an enormous number of which haunted
the outskirts of the karias.</p>

<p>While I was encamped at Durhi the Malingúr told me that
their chief, Umr Ugaz, had gone to Harar to make a compact
with Rás Makunan, agreeing to pay regular tribute and to
acknowledge his sovereignty. The Malingúr, although demonstrative
in their first welcome to me, afterwards became very
reserved, because they feared that civility to Europeans might
get them into trouble with the Abyssinians. They are in the
line of Abyssinian invasion eastward along the Fáfan Valley,
and have been utterly cowed. Having been deprived of most
of their horses their fighting power is much reduced.</p>

<p>On the 20th we travelled two marches to Las Damel, and
thence to Garabad. On reaching this place at noon, I found a
very large herd of oryx feeding on either side of the caravan
route, and shot three. On the first shot the herd, instead of
running away, charged up round the wounded one as they do
when hunted with dogs; and reloading, by a quick right and
left, I was able to bag a second and third animal. A great
deal of the meat was eaten by the men, and the rest was sun-dried
for future consumption.</p>

<p>The valley of Daghatto, on the Gálla border, said to be
swarming with elephants, was now only ten miles on the west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
of us. So halting at Garabad, I sent Géli and two Malingúr
guides, who had joined us, into the Daghatto Valley to see
what they could find; and they returned at night showing
pieces of freshly-chewed aloe, and reporting that they had seen
an elephant.</p>

<p>We marched into the Daghatto Valley next morning, passing
between low, flat-topped hills, and camped in thick umbrella
mimósas, forming a strong zeríba with felled trees, as our
guides reported the country dangerous. The jungle descended
gradually to the Daghatto stream, which was a mile to
the west of us, its course being north and south. It has its
source in the Harar Highlands, and flows towards the Webbe.
Where we struck the stream it had cut its way through very
wild and hilly country, said to harbour Gálla marauders.</p>

<p>Directly the camp had been pitched I organised a small
hunting caravan, consisting of the three fast camels, the mule,
and six men, with food for two days. We set off at once, and
soon reached the Daghatto stream. We found it to be an exquisitely
beautiful little river, overshadowed by very large and
wild forest, with hanging masses of creeper, there being a carpet
of rich grass. Footprints of elephants of different dates were
everywhere visible in the earth, and stems of trees were broken,
or the trees uprooted and overturned by the herds, as they had
fed along parallel to the course of the stream. Some of the
tracks in the soft mud close to the stream were holes two feet
deep. There was a deep and rapid current, which prevented
our crossing with the camels, but we held along the eastern
bank, going up stream, towards the north.</p>

<p>We found evidences of a large bull elephant having bathed
and fed about on the night before, and taking up his tracks for
two or three miles, the footprints which we had been following
were joined by those of several others, and soon the whole
country seemed to be covered with traces of elephants, trees
being denuded of the branches or overturned at various dates,
and it became evident that a large herd was in the valley with
us, and had been there for some days.</p>

<p>I sent Hassan Midgán and a Malingúr guide along the
river bank to reconnoitre, and ordered them to work round and
join us, when the height of the sun should indicate noon, at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
little hill visible above the sea of forest two or three miles on
ahead. Mounting the mule I made straight for this landmark
with Géli and Daura, directing Abokr and a camelman to bring
on the three camels slowly behind us.</p>

<p>Reaching the hillock I cautiously climbed to the top, and
began examining the expanse of flat, green tree-tops, to try and
discover the game.</p>

<p>Daura began dancing about and snapping his fingers with
pleasure, and pointed to some reddish brown spots among the
topmost branches of a thorn-tree half a mile away; and looking
long and carefully, I saw one of the red patches move just once,
backward and forward. We knew then that what we saw were
elephants’ ears. While we were still looking we heard the
scream of an elephant, and the patches of red were raised above
the foliage as the owners moved together through the jungle,
pressing on one another, their course marked by the great
swinging ears.</p>

<p>Soon they stopped, and stood bunched together to listen,
and we knew that they had seen or winded the two men whom
I had sent round to the left an hour ago.</p>

<p>This was awkward, but I ran hard for the line I thought
they would take when they should resume their retreat; and
getting into a thick patch of jungle, with Géli in attendance, I
waited, hiding my body behind the stem of a tree, the wind
blowing in our faces from where the elephants had last been
seen. On they came, passing us at a great pace, and letting
them go by, I fired at the ear of the largest, thirty yards away,
a loud crack answering the report of the four-bore. They only
screamed and redoubled their pace, and I ran on in their wake,
half smothered in the cloud of dust they had raised.</p>

<p>The jungle was one of the <i>billeil</i>, the worst kind of thorn
bush, and they soon left me far behind. I ran back to the hill
to get a bird’s eye view of their line of retreat, as shown by the
clouds of dust rising above the jungle, and I hoped they would
stop; but they made off up the Daghatto Valley in a straight
line, evidently bent on leaving the country.</p>

<p>While I was watching their course, a Malingúr came to me,
and said that Abokr had climbed a tree which he pointed out
to us half a mile to the east, and that he had seen elephants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
I shouldered the four-bore, and followed by Géli and Daura
leading the mule, I went to the tree, and found Abokr among
its branches. He extended his arm and pointed out the
elephants, which were a fresh lot altogether. We could only
see brown patches among the tops of some thorn-trees five
hundred yards away, and although they did not move, from
former experience we knew what they were.</p>

<p>All the elephants in Daghatto seemed to have been rolling
in reddish brown clay, which, contrasted with the vivid green
background of the trees under strong sunlight, made them
look of a brick-red colour. The jungle in which they had
taken refuge was a small grove of large trees growing together,
and for about two hundred yards in front was very thorny
<i>khansa</i> bush, the flat umbrella tops nearly meeting at a height
of about four feet from the ground. There was no cover higher
than this except the clump of trees where the elephants were,
and a few small, flimsy <i>adad</i> bushes rising above the <i>khansa</i>
undergrowth. The elephants themselves, half hidden in the
foliage of the large trees on which they had been feeding,
had a good view all around from the citadel which they
had chosen, making it difficult to approach unobserved. The
passages underneath the <i>khansa</i> bushes were too tortuous
and thorny to be of any use. A belt of high jungle on our
left grew to within a hundred yards of the herd, and at the
same distance beyond them was an extensive forest, the wind
blowing over the elephants’ heads in our faces.</p>

<p>By taking advantage of the belt of forest on our side, I
managed to get within a hundred yards; and then crawling
out into the <i>khansa</i> undergrowth for twenty yards, I sat on a
low ant-hill which rose above it and rested my elbows on my
knees, and remained motionless for some time with the rifle up,
waiting for a chance. The eyes and temple of the largest
elephant could be seen in a gap of the foliage, and taking a
careful aim at the centre of the temple I fired, and bolted back
through the <i>khansa</i> to the edge of the high trees, to receive
them there if they should charge. They made off, however, up
wind, all except one, a large bull with moderate tusks, which
we found kneeling, stone dead, under the trees, a crimson stream
flowing from a hole through the temple just where I had aimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
This was a good test of the powers of the eight-bore Paradox
gun, the distance being eighty yards.</p>

<p>Going after the others, I found they were three cows and
a calf, so I gave up the chase and returned to the hillock to
look round. A curious sight there met our eyes. The Daghatto
Valley lay before us, one unbroken expanse of tree jungle, and
we could see five or six groups of elephants making away up
the valley, going north. There were probably not less than one
hundred and twenty in all, looking very red under the low
evening sun; sometimes their backs could be seen in a shining
line above the jungle, sometimes they disappeared in the thicker
parts.</p>

<p>It was now getting late, and after a short search for the
elephant which I had hit in the head at the beginning of the
hunt, I gave up the chase and, collecting my people, made for
camp, many miles distant.</p>

<p>Had I chosen I could easily have shot more elephants upon
this occasion. Elephant-hunting is, to my mind, one of the
most exciting forms of sport, but when one has had a certain
amount of success, there can be no excuse for continuing it
merely for the pleasure of killing. Upon this journey, however,
my comfort depended greatly upon the good opinion my
Somális had of me, and I could not afford to have my motives
for not firing at elephants misinterpreted.</p>

<p>While we were returning to camp at sundown a leopard
sprang out of some undergrowth a few yards ahead of us, and
he had bounded away before I had time to fire. As we reached
camp, with Daura, as usual after a successful hunt, taking the
lead and singing, all the camp men fell into line to mark their
appreciation, and crowded round me to salaam and shake hands.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, starting early and carrying axes and knives, we
went to remove the head-skin and cut out the tusks of the bull
elephant. As we walked up to the grove of trees and came in
sight of the body, a fine panther, which had been quietly
sleeping against it on the lee side, gave us one look and
bounded away. I could not fire, as Géli’s head was just in the
way when I first saw the spotted skin. The brute had come,
no doubt, during the night to lick the blood, and had been
caught taking a nap rather later than usual. I followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
through thorny jungle to try and get another glimpse, but the
panther had disappeared.</p>

<p>We had rain all day, and returned to camp very damp,
with the tusks, in the evening. The whole valley was
practically a swamp, and we several times had to wade up to
our knees, and once up to our waists, in mud and water. Only
by first trying the depth of the slush with our own bodies did
we succeed in getting the camels on to camp.</p>

<p>We marched back on the morning of the 24th to Garabad,
and in the evening to Denleh, where we fell in with a trading
caravan of the Malingúr. On the 25th we made two marches
to Segag, by a picturesque river-bed called Sullul, with running
water, and a number of wells overshadowed by large camel-thorn
trees (<i>gudá</i>). The banks were of red earth, which had
been much undermined by the river, leaving a perpendicular
scarp of about fifty feet.</p>

<p>Until Captain Baudi, with Signor Candeo, came this way on
their journey to Imé, three years before my visit, no European
had reached either Durhi, Segag, or Imé.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> My men said that
Baudi was attacked by Rer Amáden robbers at these wells, and
I saw the site of his camp, but had no means of verifying the
report.</p>

<p>The Rer Amáden are the Ogádén tribe next to the south
of the Malingúr, and they have pastures nearly as far as the
Webbe Shabéleh river; and on the farther side of the Webbe
the Gálla country begins in the west, and that of the Aulihán
Somális in the east. My coast Somális had already begun
intriguing to try and get me back to Berbera, as they fear the
Gálla border; and my expedition nearly came to a premature
conclusion through want of information and guides.</p>

<p>The country for many days was quite uninhabited. I wanted
to send a message to the Rer Amáden, whom I had never seen,
to let them know, as I have always done, if possible, when entering
a new tribe after a stretch of uninhabited country, that my intentions
were peaceful, but the whole of the waterless bush ahead
being reported empty for forty miles, my messengers were afraid
to go forward, and we had no information where the Amáden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
were, or whether they might attack us or not. There was
also a chance of the messengers being killed by marauding
Gállas.</p>

<p>My leave was drawing to a close, and my idea, long
formed, of going to Imé and the Webbe Shabéleh seemed fated
to disappointment. The Rer Amáden were reported by the
Malingúr to be a very warlike and powerful tribe, and they
had never yet seen an Englishman; so with my small party of
twenty camelmen, further weakened by our having to detach
scouts and messengers, it seemed rather risky to make a plunge
into the country ahead without information.</p>

<p>After several ineffectual attempts to find out the Rer Amáden,
or tracks of their grazing camels, I pushed on through
uninhabited country along a good path leading southwards,
and on 27th April we halted at Enleh. Here I determined to
make one final attempt to communicate with the Amáden, and
if unsuccessful, to return by the north-eastern route to the
coast, now distant three hundred miles, going through the
Malingúr, Sheikh Ash, Rer Ali, Rer Harún, Habr Gerhajis,
and Habr Awal tribes.</p>

<p>We halted at Enleh from 27th April to 2nd May, waiting
for the scouts to return to camp. I had chosen the two
Ogádén guides, one of whom was a <i>widad</i> named Yunis, and
had given them large water-bottles and dates to carry in their
hands, and had told them to look out for rain-water, and not
to return for four days, unless they found the Amáden karias.</p>

<p>The whole of the country which we had passed over, after
leaving the open Marar Prairie at Jig-Jiga, had been low and
hilly, covered with thorn forest of no great height, and since
leaving the Jerer Valley it had been much cut up by ravines
and watercourses. The most important of these were the Tug
Fáfan, which we crossed near Náno, and the Sullul and
Daghatto streams.</p>

<p>At the seasons when it is occupied by the tribes, all this
country gives excellent pasture, and supports horses, camels,
cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats; but there were no permanent
settlements on this route between Hargeisa and the Webbe, a
distance of about three hundred miles.</p>

<p>In parts of the Jerer Valley, notably at Dagahbúr, Haljíd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Harakleh, and Jig-Jiga, cultivation could be extensively carried
on; in fact Dagahbúr was, not long ago, a thriving settlement,
but it had to be abandoned for the usual reason, tribal feuds
and the absence of any strong government. The Rer Amáden
do not generally send caravans to trade at Berbera, but deal
indirectly through the Sheikh Ash and Rer Ali.</p>

<p>At Enleh our camp was pitched on some rising ground, devoid
of bushes, but well covered with young grass, last year’s old
grass having been burnt off. All around, except close to camp,
was thorn forest from twenty to forty feet in height. Extensive
jungle fires had occurred here during the dry season, and
patches of young grass were springing up for two or three miles
on every side. This is always the best condition of any locality
for attracting game, particularly when the country is uninhabited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>I went out on the day of our arrival at Enleh and shot a
zebra with my Lee-Metford rifle, the ammunition for the larger
rifles having dwindled to only a few cartridges. At dusk I
went after a very large herd of oryx, but, losing them by the
faint moonlight a little later, I opened fire on several Sœmmering’s
gazelles, and bagged two with as many shots from the
Lee-Metford. This I found an excellent rifle, using a pin’s
head for a foresight, the pin being wedged into the slit which
was in the old pattern military weapon. We cut up the zebra
and gazelles for the twenty-five men whom I had in camp, and
the meat was soon disposed of.</p>

<p>On the 28th of April I got a Waller’s gazelle with the Lee-Metford,
and in the evening I crossed a wide valley to the
south of camp and fell in with oryx. We found them, a bull
and a cow, in good stalking cover on the farther side of the
valley, near some deserted zeríbas, with open thorn jungle and
tempting young grass. On first sighting them, two hundred
and fifty yards away to the east of us, grazing southwards, the
wind blowing from south to north, I lay down with Géli and
Hassan behind a thicket of high <i>durr</i> grass and waited. The
bull walked towards me, and then grazed for about ten minutes
behind some bushes, the cow standing looking suspiciously in
my direction. We continued lying down, and only looked up
at long intervals, each with a bunch of grass held before the
face. At last the bull appeared from behind the bushes;
and sitting up, resting my elbows on my knees, I hit him with
the Lee-Metford, and he made off at a gallop and hid in a deserted
zeríba. Following on his tracks, I was within a yard of
the zeríba before I saw the tips of his horns appearing over
the brushwood, only six feet away from me. From the position
of the horns I knew he was listening, and placing the muzzle
of the rifle into the brushwood where his chest should be, I
fired and sprang to one side, and he rushed away in the other
direction at a gallop. I ran round the zeríba just in time to
see him disappear in thick cover. Following, I took a quick
shot at him as he crossed a glade one hundred and fifty yards
away, and missed; and after another chase I ran on to him in
thick cover, standing broadside on at fifteen yards, when I gave
him a shot with a Winchester .500 Express. He walked off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
ten yards and stood again broadside on, looking at us; and
then he dropped suddenly, stone dead.</p>

<p>A day or two later I went out shooting, and got a buck
Waller’s gazelle, and in the chase lost Abokr and my camel;
and after firing twelve signal shots unsuccessfully, I returned to
camp. He afterwards turned up all right. In the evening I
went out again, and got a pair of oryx out of a large galloping
herd, emptying the Lee-Metford magazine at individual animals
at ranges of from one hundred to three hundred yards. When
after the oryx we found tracks of natives in the soil, and while
walking home to camp after nightfall we heard distant singing,
far out in the bush to the east. I told off a special guard, the
men sleeping with their cartridge belts on, and doubled the
sentries, keeping the first watch myself; the night, however,
passed without incident.</p>

<p>The next morning I made for the remains of the two oryx,
part of the meat of which we had not been able to take away,
to see whether natives had been there. The spot in the bush
was well marked by the vultures, which, having discovered the
remains for the first time at break of day, were stooping in a
slanting direction towards the place from all parts of the sky,
wings extended and nearly motionless, legs stretched perpendicularly
downwards. Except the vultures, and a large spotted
hyæna which cantered lazily away from under a bush, nearly
bursting with the banquet it had just had off the oryx, nothing
had disturbed the neighbourhood. My men said the voices of
the night before must have been those of “devils,” for we had
gone far beyond the place whence the sound had appeared to
come, and there was no track in the earth, and there had been
no rain during the night to obliterate footmarks.</p>

<p>In the evening, the game never failing, taking my two hunters
and a camelman, I followed some zebra, and by mistake shot a
mare, which dropped out of the herd, and after going a short
way fell dead. A foal, which I had not observed before, trotted
after her, and stood a few yards from the body. This occurred
in very thick country; and approaching noiselessly under cover
of a thicket, ten yards from the dead zebra, we quietly constructed
a slip-knot, loading the noose at intervals with bullets which my
men tore with their teeth and spear-points from the cartridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in my belt. Going to the edge of the thicket, a yard or two
from the foal, we tried to cast the noose over its head; but
kicking up its heels it made off through the jungle. On the
way home I fell in with a large herd of oryx, and shot three of
them after a long hunt. We prepared the meat for transportation,
covering it with bushes to keep off vultures, and marched
back towards camp an hour before sunset. While still two miles
from camp we heard voices hailing us from the east, but not
knowing who might be calling, friend or foe, we decided to walk
on to camp without answering the challenge. I only had three
men with me, and, the voices issuing from several directions, we
thought the sounds might possibly come from a force of Rer
Amáden; so we continued walking towards camp, the hailing of
the voices sounding sometimes close to us. They were so close
that, as a precautionary measure, we four more than once
grouped ourselves round the trunk of a tree, back to back, with
rifles ready. The owners of the voices had evidently heard my
rifle an hour or two before, and tried to hit off our whereabouts.</p>

<p>Arriving at camp, I found Yunis and the other guide, and
three Amáden tribesmen, waiting by my tent. It was these
men’s voices which we had heard in the bush. Yunis had good
news to tell. He and his companions had come upon some
Amáden, a small party of men who had wandered from the
main karias of their tribe, which was encamped two days’
journey to the south. This party had come into the uninhabited
country to collect gum-arabic, which they pick off
the bushes, and send down to the coast tribes by small caravans,
which return with cloth to the interior. The gum-pickers are
always a very poor lot of people, often starving, and camping
without flocks and herds, they undergo great hardships while
carrying on their trade. The “devils” of the night before
turned out to have been these gum-pickers, who, bivouacking in
the bush in a small party without fires, had been shouting to
scare lions, which had a bad reputation here. They had afterwards
seen our fires and had retired, fearing Abyssinians; and
following their tracks next day, my two guides had come up
with them. The two Amáden offered on the morrow to guide
us to their tribe and put us well on the road to Imé. They
said that their headmen, the most important of whom were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
Sheikh Abdul Káder and Jáma Deria, had heard much of the
Englishmen who were at Berbera, and wanted to see one and
shake his hand!</p>

<p>At night came Jáma Deria and Hirsi, his son, mounted on
white ponies. They slept in my camp. Jáma Deria was
really a beautiful old man. He was a fine old fighting chief
with a white beard, his features being well formed, but the
complexion nearly black; he is the leading minstrel of the Rer
Amáden tribe, and has composed songs which are sung on
horseback in the <i>dibáltig</i>, and on other occasions, far and wide
in Somáliland. His great hobby is lifting cattle and fighting
with his neighbours, with the natural accompaniments, love of
horseflesh and minstrelsy. I found Jáma Deria, despite his
failings, to be a dear old man, with splendid qualities, although
his character was rather spoilt by a strong tendency to stinginess;
however, I subsequently became great friends with him.
He expressed himself delighted that an Englishman had at
last found out the Rer Amáden; he said the old men, young
men, and children would all welcome me; and that he would
lead me to the Sheikh (Abdul Káder) at Dambaswerer, where
they hoped to keep me as long as I would stop. He said that
he knew all the Imé tribes, who were very much afraid of him;
and he hoped, now that the English were the friends of the
Rer Amáden, he would be able to keep the Abyssinians<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in
their proper place.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of May we broke up our camp at Enleh early
in the morning and marched to Galadúr, where we camped
again. Old Jáma Deria and his son escorted me, and he was
delighted to have been before the Sheikh in welcoming me to
the country. He is a rival of the Sheikh, and has sometimes
been his open enemy, having killed several of Abdul Káder’s
relations; he keeps all the neighbouring tribes in a constant
state of alarm, being a regular firebrand and loving a quarrel
for its own sake.</p>

<p>As we advanced in the fresh morning air, the old man, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
high spirits, would dash past me at full gallop, to display to
the Englishman the quality of his pony and the red tassels on
his saddle and bridle, returning after each circle to cry “<i>Mót!</i>”
I could not help thinking of old Tarquin, in the <cite>Lays of
Ancient Rome</cite>, whose spear, according to Macaulay, “shook
more with hate than age.” A Somáli, poising his spear before
throwing it, does it by a sudden jerk against the palm of his
hand, causing the shaft to quiver; and he claims that this keeps
it straight in the air, the effect being somewhat like that of the
feathers on an arrow, or the twist caused by the rifling on a bullet.</p>

<p>As we got into a bit of open grass I shot a Sœmmering’s
gazelle. The buck dropped in his tracks, and old Jáma,
hastily dismounting and handing his mare to his son, paused
an instant to whirl the free end of his tobe from his shoulder
and to coil it round his waist, leaving the chest bare; and then,
running like a two-year-old, he raced to the gazelle to perform the
<i>halal</i>—that is, to sever the jugular with his short sword, without
which operation all meat is <i>harám</i>, or unlawful, to a Mussulmán.</p>

<p>The youth who brought up the horses could not induce
them to come near to the dead gazelle; so Jáma, mounting
his beautiful young mare, which he said was “blood-shy” and
required teaching, by voice and heel coaxed her up to the meat
till she brought her dilated nostrils close to it. He made her
jump over the buck several times before he was satisfied. The
Amáden, who had perhaps never seen game shot before,
examined the hole in the buck with great interest, Jáma
remarking that the Abyssinians couldn’t do that near so well,
and that the English were good people. He said that I was
to be <em>his</em> Englishman, and while in the country shoot him lots
of zebra, as all the Amáden liked the meat very much.</p>

<p>During our evening march we were overtaken by a violent
storm, the burst of the monsoon, which occurs very locally and
at different dates in different places. We could not advance
or retire, the camels having to stand loaded for over an hour
up to their fetlocks in running water, with an impassable
torrent a little distance off on either side, where all had been
lately dry land; my cook Suleiman was caught by one of
these streams while following the caravan; and he was turned
over and over, and would have been drowned had we not gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
to his assistance. After the storm had passed we had hard
work to reach the top of the highest ground in the neighbourhood,
a mile from where we had been caught, the camels
slipping at every step on the sloping surfaces of soft red clay.
It was the worst storm I have ever experienced, accompanied
by constant thunder and vivid lightning. Lions roared in
some nasty bush round our camp at night; luckily, however,
they did not attack our horses; for the fuel on the spot being
soaked, and it being too dark to send out to search for any, we
could only make a small fire with a scanty supply which my
cook Suleiman, always thoughtful, had wrapped up in a waterproof
sheet and put on a camel just as the storm came on, for
the preparation of my evening meal.</p>

<p>Next day, the 3rd May, we made a long march and
reached Gullá. A lion roared at night, but he was on the
farther side of a precipitous watercourse which he could not pass
without going a great distance round; so he did not disturb my
camp otherwise than by the grand music of his voice, which
on the clear nights after heavy rain can be heard for miles, a
performance which it was pleasant to lie awake and listen to.</p>

<p>On 4th May, crossing a beautiful stream called Samani at
Bal Balaad, we marched to the Sheikh’s karia. Jáma Deria,
who had been with us so far, now left us. As I rode up to
Abdul Káder’s karia I was met by a dignified old man, who
turned out to be the Sheikh himself, and I respectfully dismounted
from the camel and shook hands; and the Sheikh,
by way of emphasising the welcome, fumbled at the brim of
my hat with outstretched hands to bless me, as is the custom,
by touching my forehead and mumbling a few words of the
Koran over me. Asking his permission through the interpreter,
I ordered the men to pitch camp at once among the
karias of the Amáden. I was received with enthusiasm by the
Sheikh’s people, who are his own clan of the Amáden; his
karias were also full of mullahs from every tribe. He gave
me some sheep, and a camel worth twenty-five dollars, to be
killed for my men, and a fat calf for myself; and lines of
women came carrying large <i>háns</i> decked with white beads and
full of camel’s milk; and soon a long row of these vessels was
set up at my tent door. In return I gave white shirting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
red shawls, which are afterwards picked to pieces to make
tassels for the saddlery. To the Sheikh’s principal wife I
gave a red and blue tartan-patterned tobe worth four dollars,
and a looking-glass; and to the other women I gave beads. As
the Sheikh, supported by a thick stick and two stalwart sons,
hobbled to my tent to pay me a formal call, I blew the alarm
whistle and fell in all the men two deep, and loading with
blank we fired two volleys in the air. Then, folding some red
blankets and laying them over store boxes, I made the Sheikh
and his sons and elders sit down. Abdul Káder, while sipping
his coffee, his eyes wandering continually over the strange
objects in my tent, and his fingers picking absently at my
blankets, promised to do all he could for me, remarking
significantly that he heard English people did not burn karias
and murder women!</p>

<p>The hundreds of assembled tribesmen listened in silence to
the sentences murmured in a high cracked voice by the old
man, who had lost all his front teeth. Some of his small
children, or perhaps grandchildren, naked and dusty, clung
round the poles of my tent, sucking their thumbs, and gazing
calmly at the first white man they had ever set eyes on! A
dozen horsemen of the Rer Amáden then went through the
<i>dibáltig</i>, covering us with dust, and the minstrel, sitting in the
saddle facing my tent, gave me, appropriately put into verse,
complaints against the neighbours of the Amáden, which, as a
representative of the English, I was expected to settle, this
place being about three hundred and thirty miles inland.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>While in camp here I set up a large astronomical telescope
and turned it upon Jáma Deria’s karia, a few miles away on
the side of a hill. The people came in crowds to look through
this at all hours of the day, with a running fire of comments,
such as, “By Allah! that is Jáma’s white cow. How big!
like an elephant,” and so forth. The mullahs flocked round
my tent begging for white paper to write sentences from the
Koran, which are subsequently enclosed in a leather bag and
sold, to be worn round the neck as a charm to stave off ill-luck.
I gave the mullahs several <i>tusbas</i> or scented prayer-chaplets
made of black wooden beads and worn as necklaces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
There is a superstition that a Somáli who wears a <i>tusba</i> and
does not count the beads in prayer at the regular times will be
choked by the <i>tusba</i> in revenge.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Late at night, in the pitch darkness before the moon had
risen, a small child, a little girl of seven, came over from one
of the karias to my camp, begging for food, as she was starving.
She had braved the terrible danger of hyænas, which swarm
between the karias at night, to cross to my camp; so giving her
some oryx meat and cooked rice, I sent her back under escort
to her own habitations. I suspect this poor child had no
relations. “I cannot help the child; it is not of my clan,” is
too often the answer given by great healthy Somális on being
accused of heartlessness. This is not due to natural ferocity of
character, but to thoughtlessness, what is everybody’s business
being nobody’s business; and the little sufferers starve and die.</p>

<p>Abdul Káder and Jáma Deria were both particularly glad
to help me on to Imé, because for some months past the Amáden
had been at war with the Adone or negroes at Imé; and Jáma
Deria thought this would be a good opportunity of reopening
negotiations. The country between the Sheikh’s karia and
Imé was uninhabited for seventy-five miles, and the people
told us that while passing over this tract we would be exposed
to the risk of meeting Arussi Gálla wandering bands. It
appeared that Jáma Deria and Abdul Káder, though jealous of
one another, had settled their differences for the time being
in order to assist me, and we arranged that Jáma and his son,
and Abdul Káder’s son and another Amáden, should guide me
to Imé on the 5th of May.</p>

<p>There being very little of my leave remaining, I decided
that there would not be time to take the slowly-travelling
caravan so far, and that it would be better to leave it, under
command of a good camelman, encamped at Abdul Káder’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
karias at Dambaswerer, while with my interpreter, two
hunters, and four of the Amáden, I should ride to Imé and
back. The distance would be about one hundred and fifty
miles, according to the natives, and with the help of my
mule and two Arab camels and five Amáden ponies, without
any camp equipage, we hoped to accomplish a short stay at
Imé and to be back again at Dambaswerer within six days.
A glance at the map will show the confidence we felt in the
friendship of the natives of Ogádén, to be able to cut ourselves
adrift from the caravan in unexplored country so far in the
interior. Imé is four hundred miles from the coast, and
Dambaswerer is seventy-five miles short of Imé. In 1884,
at the time of Mr. F. L. James’s journey to the Shabéleh
district to the south-east, such a ride would have been very
hazardous; but since then things have been changing for
the better every day.</p>

<p>Our cavalcade thus consisted of seven mounted Somális
and myself, four of us having rifles, the other four only shields
and spears. In the saddle-bags on the two Arab camels
Abokr and I carried a few blankets and necessaries, and a
bag of coffee, and for meat we depended on the game we
expected to fall in with. We rode during the whole of 5th
May, with a short interval to rest and cast loose the camels at
noon; and at 5 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span> we halted by the side of a pool of rain-water,
hobbled the animals, lit a fire, and threw ourselves down
in a circle round it to sleep, one man keeping watch over the
animals. At 3 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> we were again on the move, and began to
descend a long slope cut up by deep ravines, which falls to the
Webbe Shabéleh river. We lost ourselves among impassable,
precipitous watercourses several times; the guides, however,
always managed, after much difficulty, to regain the path,
which had been grown over with grass, and, because of the
Amáden raids, had been unused for a year. We reached the
Webbe Shabéleh at Imé at 1.30 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, having done the seventy-five
miles in thirty-two hours at a moderate pace without a
change of animals.</p>

<p>As we neared Imé the view became very fine. The
Shabéleh or Haines river lay before us, flowing in a tortuous
course from north-east to south-west, its banks marked by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
line of very tall casuarina-trees, with dense undergrowth of many
varieties of evergreen bush of great size and beauty. The lines of
high trees, following the winding river banks, and covering the
long narrow islands, reminded me of the banks of the Seine at
Rouen, the casuarina growing in the shape of a poplar. The
tall tops of these trees are constantly waving when there is any
breeze at all, the gray-green foliage reflecting the light and
giving a peculiarly lively character to the landscape. On the
southern side were two low rocky hills, rising from the alluvial
plain, wooded round their base; and in these woods, which
were crowned by tall graceful “toddy” palms like those of
India, lay the large cluster of beehive villages of the Adone,
which are collectively called Imé.</p>

<p>Most of the open flats near the river banks are cultivated
by these negroes, or are left as pasture-land, to be grazed over
by the Adone cattle and by the frequent herds of water antelopes
and Sœmmering’s gazelles. Behind the broad river valley,
some fifteen miles to the south, rose a wall of lofty blue mountains,
piled in picturesque confusion of peak and plateau to a
height which I judged to be not less than eight or nine thousand
feet above sea-level. The long slope of broken ground rising
from the river to the base of the mountains was covered over
its entire surface with monotonous thorn jungle. The Arussi
Gállas, who are camel-owning nomads like the Somális, occupy
these mountainous districts. These highlands are mysterious
and attractive to the traveller, for the reason that no European
penetrated them until the entry of the two well-armed expeditions
of Captain Bottiga and of Prince Ruspoli, which, so far
as I could ascertain from the Somális, were even then fighting
their way through the Gálla tribes in front of me.</p>

<p>The difficulty and expense of fitting out a Somáli expedition
may be realised when it is explained that in the four or
five hundred miles between Berbera and Imé, on the routes I
took, there was no permanent village. The karias are merely
Somáli temporary kraals, and the huts are packed on camels
when the natives move for change of pasture three or four
times in the year; and in all my journeys, except during the
week’s visit to Harar, I was never able to obtain anything but
occasionally milk and mutton or other meat. Rations of rice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
dates, and clarified butter were carried for the men for every
day we spent in the interior; also water-casks capable of
supplying us for six days when crossing the Haud. All these
supplies had to be carried on camel-back, making a very large
caravan for four and a half months, which was the time that
elapsed before we returned to Berbera, and during which we
covered about one thousand two hundred miles of route. By
much cutting down of weight I had managed to do with thirty-three
baggage camels, each carrying two hundred and seventy-five
pounds, the cost price of each camel being £2. I took no
furniture, sleeping on the ground or on camel-mats laid over
store-boxes, in a double-fly tent weighing eighty pounds.</p>

<p>As we rode over the flats near the river, I sent Jáma Deria
and his son forward to the villages, hidden among the palm
clusters two thousand yards away, to warn Gabba Oboho, the
Adone chief of Imé, of our arrival. He took, wrapped up in
the end of his tobe, an Arabic letter from Sheikh Abdul Káder.
With the other five Somális I sat down under a shady <i>gudá</i>
tree in the open plain and awaited developments, at the same
time hobbling the animals and turning them out to graze.</p>

<p>This was an exciting crisis in the course of my expedition.
Between my advanced party and the camp which we had left
behind at Dambaswerer lay seventy-five miles of uninhabited
wilderness. We were eight men in all, with four rifles. A
mile away from us was a cluster of more than a dozen large
villages teeming with suspicious and ignorant negroes, who were
of a different race, and had lately been the enemies of the
Amáden Somális who formed my escort. The only white men
they had ever seen were Baudi and Candeo, and possibly
Robecchi, and the party of Italians which had lately gone into
Gállaland under circumstances by no means peaceful.</p>

<p>While we were waiting in suspense watching the long dark
masses of beehive huts, the smoke of wood fires curling up
among the palm-trees, and wondering what reception the first
Englishman would meet at the hands of the Adone, a Sœmmering’s
gazelle came along cropping at the short grass till within
range of our tree. Unable to resist the tempting shot, resting
my elbows on my knees, I fired, and dropped him dead. I had
now given the alarm! We knew that all the villages had heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the shot, and so we caught all the animals, and tethering them
to our tree, sat in a semicircle round them, knowing that if the
Imé people should prove hostile we were in for it, and half expecting
to see Jáma and his son come galloping to us in a cloud
of dust followed by an excited, spear-throwing mob, which we
might have to stop with our four rifles!</p>

<p>At the end of a quarter of an hour of suspense, Jáma Deria
and his son appeared as two dots issuing from the forest and
galloped up to us; and after circling their ponies a few times in
triumph, and crying “<i>Mót!</i>” they dismounted, and shook hands
with us all round delightedly, in the good old Somáli way, and
we knew the suspense was over. Two good-natured-looking,
flat-nosed negroes, who had followed behind them, then ran up,
laughing, and shook hands. They were naked save a piece of
dirty tobe thrown carelessly over the shoulders. They explained,
through my interpreter, that Gabba Oboho had told
them to bid me welcome to Imé; we were to drink first at the
river, and then come to his village, where he was waiting with
his counsellors to receive us.</p>

<p>Jáma Deria said that he and his son had suddenly come on
the two Adone just inside the forest, and they, recognising the
Amáden saddlery, had run at him spear in hand; but circling
his horse round the bushes, he avoided them, and shouted out
in Somáli the purport of Abdul Káder’s letter to Gabba Oboho.
He had then left the letter on the ground, and retired a little
way. The Adone picked up the letter, and were arguing
whether this was a ruse or not, when they heard my shot at
the Sœmmering’s gazelle, and knew that Jáma Deria had spoken
the truth, and that an Englishman had really come. And so
they had run off to tell Gabba Oboho, at his hut in the nearest
village. The shot had had a very different effect in the other
Imé villages, for the inhabitants had ferried the women and
children across the river on rafts, to a place of refuge, believing
the gun to have been fired by an Abyssinian force; and when
we advanced into Imé we saw them perched in hundreds among
the caves and recesses of the small hills across the water; but
on seeing us enter the first village peacefully, and observing our
meeting with their chief, they soon flocked down to look at the
wonderful stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>We rode through a succession of <i>jowári</i> fields to the river.
After we had allayed our thirst, our guides led us to a large
<i>darei</i>, or fig-tree, standing in a small glade, and here we found
Gabba Oboho and all the elders of the Adone seated in solemn
conclave on the grass, to the number of about a hundred. My
advent was a great event to these negroes, whose dull lives are
only enlivened by Abyssinian or Amáden raids, and who live
their otherwise quiet existence on the banks of the Webbe,
cultivating the ground or herding cows.</p>

<p>I walked through the throng to Gabba Oboho; and shaking
hands with him and a dozen of the nearest counsellors, and
spreading a camel-mat in the centre of the circle, I sat down
with Adan Yusuf, my interpreter, sending the rest of my party
away with the animals to get fodder and cook their evening
meal. The greeting of the negroes was very friendly; they
pressed round me, feeling my Elcho boots and admiring the
leather and particularly the laces, pinching the material of my
corduroy breeches; and taking off my canvas shooting hat,
which was passed round with a buzz of wonder and then
politely handed back to me. Gabba Oboho could not conceal
his curiosity, and asked me why my arm was brown outside
and white under the sleeve; so I gave a lecture on the effect
of the sun on the European skin to an open-mouthed and
admiring audience.</p>

<p>Gabba, now managing to secure silence, in the course of a
long oration said he was glad an Englishman had come; that
he and all the headmen wished to sign a paper with my
Government, that all the inhabitants of the Webbe were
“subjects” of the English, who, they had often heard, were
good people; and he now wished to know at once whether I
had brought the paper, so that he might make his mark. He
stopped, and the expectant crowd waited for my reply. I explained
that I had not been ordered to visit the country and
had brought no paper; that I had come to look for wild
animals and to see the great river, the Webbe, of which during
some years I had heard so much; that the English wished to
be friends with all people, and the officer who signed papers
lived at Aden, more than twenty days’ journey, as they knew,
to the north. I found it difficult to make them understand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
difference between a British officer on duty and one on leave,
and a subdued buzz of disapproval showed that they were not
half satisfied with my reply.</p>

<p>An Adone elder pointed to our mule, and asked where we
had got it; and on hearing it was a present from Rás Makunan,
he said, “Ah! it is as we feared, you English have sold us to
the Amhára!” I said the English had done nothing of the
kind. I also told the elders that the English would be
pleased if more caravans came trading to Berbera, and that
Government would assist such caravans in every way possible.
Gabba Oboho then led me, through an avenue of high palm-trees,
to the nearest village, and into a dirty courtyard occupied
by two cows and some goats, in the corner of which
his own huts stood. He had turned out of the largest and
caused it to be swept for my use; and he gave my followers a
raised platform of wicker-work, outside the hut, to sleep upon.</p>

<p>I remained in the village all the evening, receiving the
visits of the leading natives and a dense crowd of men, women,
and children, constantly pressing round the hut, old Gabba
now and then angrily whipping them off with a cowhide whip.
The elders of Imé were very friendly indeed; and the climax
was reached when one venerable, pointing to his hut in the
distance, said I might have it if so disposed, and his best wife
into the bargain; and he patted one of the surrounding females
on the head. She was by no means a beauty; and turning to
him and smiling blandly, I answered, “<i>Labadi donei-máyu</i>” (I
don’t want either of them), much to the amusement and delight
of his second-best wives.</p>

<p>The headmen asked me many questions about Europe; and
whether I thought the Italians could conquer Abyssinia if so
disposed; and which was the greatest nation in the world. To
this poser I replied, “Allah knows; we are all strong,” whereat
they exclaimed to one another, “He tells the truth; if he were
a liar he would say the English were the strongest.” It
speaks well for the management of affairs on our North Somáli
coast, that although these people were so far in the interior
that they had hitherto never seen one of my countrymen, yet
they knew and felt respect for the English name.</p>

<p>The Adone living at Imé have been great cultivators of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
<i>jowári</i>, which they eat; but they declared that the Abyssinians
had been there some months before my visit, had shot several
people, and taken off live-stock; and that they sent emissaries
occasionally to collect tribute. Many of the Imé people have
therefore left Imé and have gone to Karanleh, another large
collection of villages three marches down the river to the east;
and they say that Karanleh has now become the more important
place. The Imé people certainly seemed very poor and very
timid. They were afraid to go outside the palisades of the
villages at night, and they held Jáma Deria and the Amáden
in great awe. Gabba Oboho said that if I wanted to shoot
buffaloes, hippopotami, and giraffes, I must go three days’ march
to the south, to the Webbe Web, which is a tributary of the
Webbe Ganána or Juba river, and that the people there were
Gurré Gállas. He represented them to be “good people,” and
that if I were a friend of his they would be pleased to see me,
if I did not loot or fight with them; and that I had better go
to Berbera and return in two months’ time, when our camels
would be able to ford the Webbe. He said that for my caravan
to cross on their clumsy rafts in the present flooded state of the
river would take from four to seven days.</p>

<p>My leave was now coming to an end. I had already asked
for an extension, but to find out whether it was granted I had
to make all haste to the coast. We stayed four days at Imé
hunting for the <i>balanka</i> or waterbuck, which is unobtainable
anywhere in Somáliland except on the Webbe. Crowds of
Adone thrust themselves on us during our rambles, hoping to
get meat. I found the sport in the Webbe valley very interesting,
though the heat was great, intensified by the high
buffalo-grass through which we had to force our way. We
were generally out on foot all day, often going to the river to
rest in the cool, dense forest which clothes the banks for a
hundred yards on either side of the stream. I shot two waterbuck,
thinking, on account of their small size, that they must be
a new species. But later experience on a second trip proved
them to be young ones.</p>

<p>We found the cotton-bush flourishing wild on the river
banks, and heard that cotton is grown farther to the east,
towards the Shabéleh district. The name of this river at Imé is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
not the Webbe Shabéleh, but the Webbe Sidáma, which, I heard,
is the Gálla name for the river. Shabéleh appears to be the
name of the district through which the river runs at the point
where Mr. F. L. James’s expedition struck it in 1884. The chief
sources of the Juba are the Webbe Web, Webbe Ganána, and
Webbe Dau, in order from north to south. The Imé people
were calling their own river simply the Webbe (River).</p>

<p>I had now only time to ride back to the Rer Amáden
karias at Dambaswerer, where my caravan was, and then to go
quickly for thirty marches, occupying fifteen days, to Berbera.
Bidding good-bye to our friends the Adone, we left at 2.50 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>
on the 9th May for Dambaswerer, mounted on the same
animals which had brought us to the Webbe. We rode till
late at night, sleeping as before in the open, and at 3 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>
resumed our ride, and going on with two short intervals for
repose, we reached Dambaswerer at sunset on the same day.
The sturdy Abyssinian mule which I rode came in first, then
the two Arab camels, and last the five Amáden on their ponies,
straggling in one by one; these latter were very much done up,
having been in bad condition at starting.</p>

<p>Rás Makunan’s mule had been a marvel of staying capacity
throughout the journey, and I would never wish for a better
animal for steady work. The Arab trotting camels from Aden
are excellent, having both speed and endurance; and a certain
amount of kit can be carried on them in saddle-bags in addition
to the rider.</p>

<p>On the evening of 11th May we parted from Abdul Káder,
and made an evening march to Jáma Deria’s own karia. Here
we remained one night, leaving early for our northern journey.
Jáma Deria’s people received me with enthusiasm, the crowds
pressing round the camp. Their great delight was the coloured
picture in the Zoological Society’s <cite>Proceedings</cite> of the Somáli
wild ass, which had become so dirty and so battered by handling
that I had mounted it upon the cover of a packing-case to
keep it together. The people fought with each other to get
round me and see it; those who had not seen the picture kept
besieging my camp, crying out, “Show us the picture.” I showed
the women, as a great favour, a coloured print from an illustrated
paper of two pretty English girls skating, which raised a clamour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
of admiration, one stout <i>gabad</i> (maiden), with tresses reeking
with butter, calling out, “Why did Allah make us black and
these white?” The men beginning to crowd round, and the
remarks becoming too demonstrative, I put away the picture
amid deep groans of disappointment. The men of the tribe
sat round my tent in a dense mass as I produced a book of
engravings of the Franco-Prussian war, from the pictures of
Détaille and De Neuville, and as I explained each picture
through the interpreter their faces became grave at the thought
of so many white men fighting with rifles together, and of the
numbers of dead. Contrary to my expectation they thoroughly
understood all the pictures, liking, of course, the coloured ones
the best. The snow upon the ground was the hardest thing to
explain, but I had men among my escort who had been to
London and Marseilles, as firemen on steamers, and I left it
to them. Some of the people said, “It is all very wonderful;
why are we not like the English, who have so big a name?
Why has Allah given us nothing and you everything?”</p>

<p>Jáma’s people told me the Abyssinians were sending a strong
expedition into the Arussi Gálla country shortly. They said
also that last year the Arussi Gállas came from the direction of
Daghatto in the north-west, and destroyed ten karias of the
Amáden in a single night. A nephew of Jáma Deria, an
actively built, tall young man, came to me saying he heard all
white men were doctors, and would I examine him? and throwing
the loose end of his tobe from his shoulder he exposed a
ghastly wound. A small throwing spear had entered a few
inches below the left nipple, and passing through his body, had
protruded at the back between the shoulder blades. The wound
at the back had healed, but the larger wound in the breast,
nearly an inch wide, was open and discharging freely. Asking
when the wound had been received, I was astonished to learn
that it had been in a fight with some Gálla robbers in the
previous <i>Gu</i>, or heavy rains, at least ten months before. The
man had lived, and had latterly been going about his business,
with the wound unhealed. He seemed thin, but otherwise not
much the worse. I made him a big poultice, and advised
him to take care of himself and not catch cold, and he and
his relations went away, believing in my treatment. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
glad to hear from Jáma Deria, on coming this way four months
later, that the man was still alive, and getting well; and I feel
certain that the healthy, dry air of this elevated country, combined
with total abstinence from liquor, and diet consisting
almost entirely of camel-milk, gives a wound a much better
chance than it would have under other circumstances.</p>

<p>Jáma Deria begged for everything in my tent on the evening
of my arrival; he very much wanted a coloured plaid, and
I found out privately that he had forbidden Gabba Oboho to
ask for it when I left Imé, saying I had promised it to himself.
He never, however, succeeded in making me part with it. He
begged hard for my revolver, and I let him fire at an ant-hill.
His womenfolk and all his relations begged me not to give it
to him, for they said, “If you give that dreadful old man a
pistol there will be no staying in the country; he will go and
murder Abdul Káder and his sons, and will then go and make
war on the Karanleh people.” On my shaking him off next
morning, as I did after he had ridden by my side for four miles,
always begging the coveted plaid and revolver, he finally shook
hands with evident regret, saying he hoped I would come back
and bring plenty of English with me, they would all be welcome;
and I was to mind and let him know beforehand by a mounted
messenger, so that he might have time to come and welcome
us before his enemy, Sheikh Abdul Káder, could forestall
him. A crowd followed us for quite a mile from the karias,
saying they were sorry we were going; the English were
their friends, and the Amhára would be afraid to do anything
now.</p>

<p>I may here mention that Rás Makunan of Harar is the only
Abyssinian whose name carries with it any respect in Ogádén.
He has the reputation for trying to be just; and Somális say
that if they could gain access to him the tyrannies of frontier
Abyssinians would be stopped.</p>

<p>On the evening of the 12th May, the day on which I had
parted from Jáma Deria, we went on to a place in the uninhabited
thorn bush called Anamaleh. It having been a very
hot day and the camels being tired, at an hour before sunset
we halted. While the men were engaged in pitching the camp,
taking my .577 Express rifle, I strolled off quite alone into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
bush to the east to look for gazelles. Getting on to a slight
rise, I found myself on the top of a plateau, and here I tried
to stalk two of the red Waller’s gazelles; but, hearing the
noise made by my men pitching camp four hundred yards away,
they made off. I then walked through open thorn jungle till
I suddenly came on two oryx, which galloped away, but by
a rapid shot as they were disappearing among the trees I
brought one to the ground. Firing three more shots as signals,
I brought up Géli and Hassan, and we carried the skull and
haunches to camp, leaving the rest of the meat on the
ground.</p>

<p>I always gave orders to my sentries to wake me if they
heard a lion roar, because it is a sound which is not often heard,
even in Somáliland, where lions are so plentiful; and it is
always so interesting to hear. This night the sentry called me
at 1 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and at first I heard the low moans of a lion a mile
or two away; then, after half an hour of silence, just as I was
falling asleep, we again heard him roar louder, and, as it seemed,
at the spot where we had left the oryx meat the evening before.
He was heard again during the night; and so when I was
awakened by the intense cold which precedes the dawn I roused
Suleiman the cook, and then swallowing a cup of hot coffee, I
prepared for a lion hunt. I told Adan Yusuf to take charge
of the caravan and march about ten miles, and that we would,
after the hunt, pick up the tracks of the camels; and he was
to have the tent pitched and dinner ready at the noon camp
awaiting my arrival.</p>

<p>As the sun rose I took a trotting camel, the mule, Daura
Warsama, Abokr, the two hunters Géli and Hassan, and a
Malingúr guide, with blankets, water-bottles, and dried meat;
and we made straight for the spot where we had left the dead
oryx, knowing well that we should find fresh lion tracks round
the body. There was no oryx, but looking on the ground we
saw last night’s story; a heap of half-digested grass and stains
of blood all over the ground showed where the lion had cleaned
the carcase, and the trail where he had dragged it away led to
the north-east over smooth red earth; and we easily followed
it, dotted as it was occasionally by the broad pugs of the
lion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>After we had gone a mile we came to a glade of yellow
grass about three feet high, and in the centre of this glade,
which was a quarter of a mile broad, were three or four low,
flat, <i>khansa</i> mimósas growing close together. Three foxes ran
out from these, going off at different angles, and looking beyond
the bushes we saw the lion dragging the carcase slowly over
the ground, and keeping the bushes between himself and us.
He looked grayish black, and I could see over the top of the
grass that he had a fine mane. The distance was about one
hundred and twenty yards, and as I thought he had winded us,
and there was no time to be lost, I sat down, and holding the
rifle, rested my elbows on my knees to fire. But I could see
nothing over the bushes, so I again rose to my feet, and seeing
he was still holding on into the open, pulling along the carcase,
I walked up closer, keeping under cover of the bushes, and then
I sat down again, holding the sights of the rifle fixed on a gap
in the bushes where I expected to see his dark mane and head
appear. He duly walked on, and his body was in full view in
the gap when I fired. The shock told loudly, and answering
it with a short and rather dismal roar, he bounded away at a
good pace, dropping the carcase of the oryx; and crossing the
grass he rushed into a long, dark jungle of mimósas, and we lost
sight of him for the time. The remains of the oryx, consisting
of the shoulders, ribs, and half the spine, lay where the lion
had dropped them on being hit, and the path he had taken
was plainly visible by the blood which had been plentifully
sprinkled and smeared on the blades of the grass as he went
along.</p>

<p>The hunt became more exciting as we followed into the
dense <i>khansa</i> bushes, whose flat, wide-spread tops, meeting at a
height of about five feet, formed very dark alleys, through which,
however, the lion had kept on at the same pace. We skirted
along a hundred yards to our right, to a thin place in the covert,
and then crossing and searching the farther edge we found his
tracks leading out into another glade, and so, leaving the jungle
behind, we held on after him. Finding he had gone into
another of these dark <i>khansa</i> jungles, we made a circuit round
the outside till we were opposite to where he had gone in; but
we found he had not left the <i>khansa</i>, so we continued round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
edge till we came to the point where we had abandoned the
tracks as they entered the jungle.</p>

<p>He was therefore evidently in the covert, which we had
ringed completely, and there was nothing to be done but to
follow him by the blood along these dark alleys till we came
on him. We should find one of three things: either the lion
would be seen by us alive in the covert, where I hoped to shoot
him; or we should find he had bounded away in front of us;
or we should find him lying dead. Following a wounded lion
into the <i>khansa</i> is very exciting work, because if he charges
there is so little room that it is possible one may shoot a man
instead of the lion; and also when pressing through with rifle
at full cock, the slightest catching of the trigger or hammers in
the branches would cause an accident. It is almost impossible
to move through these thorns without a sound, and the lion, if
he is crouching, can mark your progress towards him, and will
certainly see you first.</p>

<p>Moving into the thicket yard by yard, we found where the
lion had been lying while we had been walking round him on
the outside; and he had got up and bounded away and out of
the cover, his pugs on the soft sand outside, where the grass
was thin, being over my boot-marks, showing that he had only
just gone. We followed this lion for nearly three miles, through
glades of grass and dense strips of <i>khansa</i>, taking the precaution
to “ring” each strip to ascertain whether he had gone out on
the farther side, thereby avoiding much unnecessary danger
and loss of time. Many times he had managed to sneak away
without being seen when we were close to him; so, as the
sun was now hot, and we were very much done up with the
hard work, we sat down to consult; we thought also that if
we left him sitting in one place long enough to get his
wounds stiff, there would be more chance of coming up with
him. We decided it would be best for Abokr, Daura, and the
Malingúr, with the mule and camel, to follow very slowly
on the tracks, thus driving the lion in front of them, while,
with my two hunters Géli and Hassan, I made a circuit
round to the front, and sat in the grass, ready to fire at the lion
in case he should sneak past us. We tried this twice without
success; but the third time the party with the camel followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
the tracks into a strip of <i>khansa</i> half a mile long, its length
being in the direction in which we were going. Under the
bushes it was so dark that sometimes we could scarcely see the
sights of our rifles. The lion, if lying anywhere in this, would
be certain to sneak away under cover, and if I went quickly
along outside and sat down where the bushes were thin, as the
cover was only about a hundred yards wide, he could not pass
without our seeing him.</p>

<p>We ran on along the edge of the jungle, and getting to a
thin place we sat down to wait for the slowly-moving men and
animals to drive the lion to us. I had scarcely settled down
when Hassan gently patted me on the back and pointed ahead,
and there was the lion already stealing along in front, limping
painfully. The distance was ninety yards, and sitting down
and aiming at him over the grass I hit him again, the bullet
catching him in his already lacerated forearm. We crouched
to see under the smoke, which hung in the damp grass (for
there had been heavy rain in the early part of the night), and
we heard his growl as he sprang into the mimósas. Hassan
spied him again two hundred yards farther on, as we were running
to try and keep him in sight, and bringing myself to a halt
suddenly and putting up the rifle, I fired again, catching him in
the shoulder. He roared again and fell in the bushes. We
advanced, and thought he had gone on; and we were about to
run after him when Daura, who had come up, pointed him out
to me crouching in the thick bushes thirty yards away, his head
between his paws. We all stood still, and then as I moved
sideways to try and spot him he gave a low growl. I could
not see him plainly, but fired into the dark yellow mass which
Daura had shown me, and which I believed to be the lion. The
shot told loudly as if hitting bone, and all was silent, the yellow
patch remaining in the same place. We then walked round the
mimósa bush through which I had fired, and found the lion
lying on his side, unconsciously gnawing his wounded forearm.
As we stood over him he showed signs of reviving, and I gave
him another shot. He was a fine lion, and we were very glad
at the successful end to our hard work.</p>

<p>Allowing my men to skin the lion, I retired to the shade
of a spreading <i>khansa</i>, and opening a haversack which had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
brought on the camel, I made a hearty lunch of oryx meat and
water. We then put the skull and wet lion-skin on the camel,
and after another hour or two, following the tracks of the
caravan, we found the camp pitched and my tent ready. My
men, of course, all insisted on shaking hands in congratulation.
The skin of the lion when pegged out in camp measured nine
feet six inches. He was an old fellow, with a good deal of
gray in his mane.</p>

<p>We left Géli and Hassan to rest under the trees and watch
the skin of the lion, which we had stretched to dry in the hot
sun for two hours, and telling them towards sunset to pick up
the skin and bring it on to the evening camp, we went on to a
place called Dólababa. We made three more marches through
an extensive forest of <i>khansa</i> called Dúd Libah, or the “Lion’s
Forest,” and in this I knocked over a buck lesser koodoo.</p>

<p>On the 15th we again came among natives, at a place
called Tálla. There were five karias here, and the people, who
were Rer Amáden, welcomed us warmly. I sat up for a lion
in a zeríba, but without success. The people said that lions
were eating men daily to the north, at the Malingúr karias a
few marches ahead. This was good news, but the sequel was
to be a sad one!</p>

<p>Passing through my old camp at Segag, I made a short
trip into the Daghatto Valley, but bagged nothing at first,
although there were many lion tracks about. While hunting
along the river on the evening of the 18th, I shot a beautiful
lesser koodoo buck; and returning towards sunset, when nearing
camp we detected a lioness in the grass, but she saw us
first, and a hurried shot missed her as she bounded away.
She had been stalking my camels which were scattered round
camp feeding before being driven in for the night.</p>

<p>Four marches more, during which we experienced heavy
thunder-storms, brought us to Durhi, the place where, on coming
from Berbera, we had found the Malingúr burying a woman
who had been killed by a lion. The two large karias between
which we had formerly camped were deserted. I made a
zeríba outside camp, and sat up unsuccessfully for lions in it
on the night of 19th May. My men made a great noise, singing
in chorus to attract lions; and Daura Warsama, one of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
best men, led the singing, sometimes running out into the dark
night and calling, “<i>Libaha káli, kaleiya, Sirkál-ki wa dóneiya!</i>”
(Oh, lion, come; the Sahib wants you!) Daura was a fine fellow,
whom I had engaged at Bulhár, belonging to the Jibril Abokr
tribe. He and the interpreter, Adan Yusuf, were older than
most of the men, who were almost boys, and, like many of the
Jibril Abokr, in his youth he had been a great raider. He
was always full of fun, danced well, and led the men’s amusements,
and was the most popular man in camp, as well as
the smartest I had out of a particularly good lot. Daura
had been with me on five expeditions during 1891-93. On
this trip, since we had left Harar, I had given him charge of
Rás Makunan’s mule, as he knew a good deal about horses.</p>

<p>Finding the lions had left Durhi, having, no doubt, followed
the karias, as lions will, we struck camp next morning and
made for Dagaha Madóba,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> where we expected to find the
Malingúr. The whole of the ground between Durhi and
Dagaha Madóba appeared to be hidden under an unbroken
expanse of <i>khansa</i> bush, covering the low hills and wave-like
undulations of the country as far as the eye could reach on
every side. Game was plentiful, and we saw Sœmmering’s and
Waller’s gazelles, zebra and oryx. I shot two zebras and
wounded an oryx in the course of a long hunt which took me
several miles to the south-east of the caravan track. When I
first came on the zebras at about 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, Abokr was riding the
Arab camel far behind me, and the party with me consisted of
my two hunters Géli and Hassan, and Daura Warsama, while
I rode my mule. I had been riding armed only with a pistol,
Daura carrying my Express rifle; and when we saw the zebras
and I dismounted, Daura pushed the rifle into my hands, and
jumping into the saddle with a switch in his own hand, took
the mule away to the rear to join Abokr, and, as I thought, arm
himself with one of the rifles which were on the camel, while
Géli, Hassan, and I ran after the zebras.</p>

<p>At the end of the hunt, more than an hour afterwards,
while we were cutting up the zebra meat, Abokr came up leading
the camel and mule, and looking put out. He said he had
caught the mule, which he had found galloping about riderless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and he thought that Daura must have come to some harm from
Gálla marauders.</p>

<p>Carefully going back to where Abokr had caught the mule,
and taking up the back trail, we met two Malingúr, the first
we had seen for some days; and answering to our anxious inquiries
they first, native-like, said they knew nothing, and then
that they had seen marks in the ground, showing that a lion
had carried away a man. Promising a reward, I took these
men as guides, and they led us to a small ravine, where, on
examining the sand, we found what had been poor Daura’s fate.
While he had been quietly riding along at a walk across the
ravine a lioness had rushed upon the mule, which, shying, had
thrown Daura upon the ground and galloped away. The lioness
had sprung upon Daura, and after a struggle, as was shown
by the state of the sand, killed him; and his stick, broken in
three places, lay on the scene of the fight. The lioness had
then dragged him away into the jungle, up a slope covered
with thick <i>khansa</i> bushes; and following at a run, we saw
pieces of red-bordered waist-cloth, which we knew to be
Daura’s, hanging to the thorn bushes; later on the piece of
leather, enclosing a verse of the Koran, which he had worn
round his neck, and the pouch, with a jag and piece of oiled rag,
with which he had been accustomed to clean his own rifle, and
which he had always carried, attached to an old luggage-strap,
round his waist. On coming to some very large and dense
<i>khansa</i> bushes a little ahead of the men, I at last found
Daura’s body. Every vestige of clothing had been torn off by
the bushes. There were twenty holes in his throat from the
teeth of the lioness, and his right leg had been bitten off at the
hip, leaving a foot of the thigh-bone protruding. His hands and
cheeks were also bitten through, showing that he had fought for
his life; and it seemed particularly hard luck that he of all my
men had been caught thus unarmed, for he was the best shot
in the party, and would have been well able to defend himself
if he had only carried the Martini-Henry which was usually in
his possession.</p>

<p>The lioness had disappeared; so wrapping Daura’s body in
a waterproof sheet, and roping it up on to a camel, I started
the men off for camp, and cantered on ahead on the mule to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
give orders for a grave to be dug. I had first asked my men
to help me follow the lioness up at once, but they insisted
that Daura must be buried first.</p>

<p>As I reined up in camp the camelmen came to me smiling
to say “<i>Salaam aleikum</i>,” expecting to hear that I had
bagged a lion, which had made me late. Passing those in
front I rode into the zeríba quietly and said, “Daura is dead.”
A curious change came over all the men, who stood about
awkwardly, not knowing where to look; and when I told off
men for the burying party, and another party to follow the
lioness with me, the men moved about dreamily as if not
understanding the calamity which had fallen upon them.
Some one said, “Not Daura? Not our Daura?” and they only
realised what had happened when Daura’s body was brought
up on the camel and laid on the grass before them.</p>

<p>I determined to devote the next twenty-four hours to hunting
up the lioness, and having organised a party of trackers, I
left the remainder of the men to bury my follower, and we
started off on foot for the <i>khansa</i> thicket where we had found
the body. We described a circle at fifty yards’ distance from
the thicket, the ground being very stony and covered with
bushes, when we at last came upon the track of the lioness;
and following this for three miles over most difficult ground,
always covered with dense thickets, at sunset we gave it up.</p>

<p>Returning to camp I chanced to look round, when my eye
fell upon the lioness, her head being raised above a tuft of
grass in a passage between two <i>khansa</i> bushes.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Turning
round I took a quiet pot shot at her; a lioness’s head half
hidden in grass, at ninety yards’ distance and in the dusk,
is not a good target, and before I could see under the smoke
I knew that I had missed, for there was only the ringing of
the metal of my rifle in my ears, and no answering thud of
the bullet hitting flesh. Running up to the spot on which
she had been crouching, we examined the track where she had
bounded away, and holding the trail for a quarter of a mile
through the thick covert, and with the greatest difficulty, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
men kneeling over displaced gravel, broken twigs, and other
scanty evidences of her passage, and finding no sign of blood,
we gave her up and sadly made for camp, which was reached
an hour or two after dark.</p>

<p>On the next day we again took up the signs from where
we had left them, slight rain having fallen in the night; and
search as we would, we could never find any indication of her
having stayed in the neighbourhood. All the tracks were those
of the night before, and making a final circular cast of a mile
round through the bush over gravelly ground, we gave up the
search, and I resolved to march on towards the coast, having
no more leave to spare.</p>

<p>Passing Daura’s grave we surprised two hyænas trying to
grub up the stones that had been heaped over the poor fellow,
and dropped one dead, and sent the other moaning away with
a bullet in his ribs. The Malingúr, who turned out to be those
who had been at Durhi a month ago, begged me to remain and
have another try for the lion and lioness (for there were a pair
of man-eaters here), so I had a zeríba built, and tied up a
donkey, and sat up all night six feet away from it, but without
result. The Malingúr said that since the lion had killed the
woman a month ago, five men and another woman had been
carried off by the pair, my man Daura being the eighth human
victim within the month!</p>

<p>We resumed our journey on the following morning towards
the coast.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Passing through the Sheikh Ash tribe and thence
by Milmil, we reached the Rer Ali at Warma-kés in the Haud
Plateau, after eight marches, on 24th May.</p>

<p>The Rer Ali turned out fifty horsemen to <i>dibáltig</i> before
me, and I gave a show in return, advancing over the plain and
firing volleys of blank cartridge with my twenty camelmen,
and whistling them up to form rallying groups against cavalry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
I refused, however, to part with any tobes, so they said I was
“good but stingy.” They told me that lately an English
officer had been sent from Aden to Harar, and he had ordered
the Abyssinians to evacuate the town within a fortnight. This
information turned out to be based on my own peaceful visit
to Rás Makunan, and was thus distorted by passing from
mouth to mouth! We made a detour to the east of several
days’ journey in order to come on to ground frequented by
Clarke’s gazelle, and I was so fortunate as to shoot a very good
buck of this rare antelope and to pick up two pairs of horns.</p>

<p>While marching through a jungle called Gouss in the Haud,
I started about forty oryx, which galloped past us looking like
a body of cavalry with sloped swords. Sorely tempted, I fired
at the galloping line, and then ran up and found a splendid
bull lying dead. His horns were the best I have ever possessed,
being nearly three feet long, very thick, and with a slight and
very beautiful curve backwards.</p>

<p>A large Somáli caravan, going to Berbera, took advantage
of our escort to pass through the Eidegalla tribe with us. I
found some interesting artificial pools in the Eidegalla Haud,
and the natives told me that these had been dug out from time
to time in honour of well-known <i>Sultáns</i> and elders who had
died. I examined them, and was glad to find that they held
water for many weeks after rain had fallen, a proof that the
red Haud soil will hold rain-water in suitable places, and that
tanks might be made on a larger scale.</p>

<p>As we came to the Eidegalla tribe, the men, women, and
children ran away on first sighting us, thinking we were
Abyssinians; but when they recognised us they were civil
enough. On the evening of 3rd June we arrived at Syk fig-tree,
near the top of the Jeráto Pass, which is sixty miles from
Berbera, and leads from the high Ogo country down into Guban,
the coast district. Coming down into the defile called Aff-ki-Jeráto
next day, I met some Biladiers, or native irregular
police, with my mail-bag, containing four months’ letters; and
finding that, owing to my having received an extension, my
leave would not expire immediately, I settled down steadily
to hunt the large koodoo in the great Gólis Range, round Gán
Libah, Henweina, and Garbadir.</p>

<p>We descended the Jeráto Pass to Mandeira on 4th June.
This pass has since been improved by an engineer officer from
Aden, and there is now a good road. Once caravans had the
greatest difficulty in getting up or down the pass. On this
day I divided the men and animals into two caravans, one-half
to remain with me in the mountains, the other half to go to
Berbera, where the men would be paid off and the camels
sold.</p>

<p>On the following day I took the half of the caravan which
I had chosen for the koodoo-hunting trip, and marched three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
miles, from Mandeira wells to a small spring just under the
crest of Gán Libah Mountain, which is six thousand feet
above sea-level. The height of our camp here was four
thousand five hundred feet. In the morning, while the men
were moving camp to the new site, I took my two hunters
Géli and Hassan, and an Esa Musa guide from some karias
which we found at Mandeira, and searched the hills for koodoo,
but only saw some female koodoo and young ones, so we made
for camp, which we found pitched in a very pretty little glade
on the hillside. I had no tent, but a small hut made of camel-mats,
covered over with waterproof sheets, and fastened to
some poles which we cut from the thorn bushes. To the east,
just below camp, was a rocky torrent-bed, with stretches of flat
sand in the bottom, and a small stream trickling through it,
forming waterfalls of a foot or two in height, and flowing northwards
into the Tug Mandeira. All the country for a mile or
two round was very much broken and cut up by ravines from
Gán Libah and other high mountains overlooking the camp;
and in these ravines were long strips of the <i>gudá</i> jungle, with
thick aloe undergrowth four feet high.</p>

<p>Three miles north-west, on the right bank of the Tug
Mandeira sand-river, rises a very curious pinnacle or boss of
hard rock, called Dagaha Todobálla, or the “Rock of the Seven
Robbers” (from <i>todoba</i>, seven). The story goes that seven
Jibril Abokr robbers came from the west on one of their
periodical raids, to search for plunder among the Esa Musa
flocks grazing at the foot of the Gólis Range; but the Esa
Musa collected in force, and these men fled to the top of the
almost inaccessible rock, where they were surrounded and
finally cut to pieces by the enraged tribesmen. Rising as it
does to a height of about a hundred feet above a sea of jungle
of the large <i>gudá</i> thorn-trees, it forms a very beautiful addition
to Mandeira scenery, which indeed is all very striking. There
are several of these rocks and hillocks in the Mandeira Valley,
and the large thorn jungles round their bases are the home of
that lovely antelope, the lesser koodoo, which combines many
of the beauties of both the large koodoo and the African
striped bushbuck, and is midway between them in size.
There are also wart-hog, Waller’s gazelles, the tiny <i>Sakáro</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
as well as guinea-fowl and large koodoo in the mountains
close by.</p>

<p>On the evening of 5th June I went out again with the same
men, holding south-west along the lower slopes of a ridge
called Gol Adéryu, or the “Hill of Koodoos”; and here I bagged
a splendid specimen of a koodoo bull. When Géli first saw
him we were moving along the base of the hills, crossing
several torrent-beds, all more or less hidden under <i>gudá</i> trees,
with bare gravelly ridges, or ridges covered with grass and aloe
jungle, forming the watersheds. He was about three hundred
yards away in front of us, standing nibbling the young shoots
of the <i>gudá</i> where a thick mass of this kind of jungle crowned
a ridge. The ground where the koodoo had taken up his
position was higher than the low open ridge on which we had
been standing when we saw him; but the wind was blowing in
our faces, and was therefore in our favour. Two small torrent-beds
intervened between us and the game. His body was
quite concealed by the dark green foliage, only the head and
shining horns being occasionally visible as he stretched himself
out to reach down a branch, and it was long before I could
make out what Géli was pointing at. But looking through my
field-glass I saw that I had to deal with the bearer of a splendid
pair of horns, the best I had seen, the whitish tips looking a yard
apart, and the evening sun being reflected from the wide spirals.</p>

<p>We sank flat to the ground together where we had stood,
and lay, without daring to move, fearing that some unlucky chance
should cause him to come out of the bush and look towards
us. We spoke in whispers, taking many more precautions
than were really necessary at this distance because of the great
size of this particular old bull, and the intense fear I had of
losing him. We lay upon a flat, open piece of gravel about
ten yards square; and so nervous did we become that we
dared not creep along the ground from our respective positions
far enough to tear down a branch to hold before the face,
preferring to lie motionless in the open, in full view, to the
chance of a movement catching his eye.</p>

<p>We lay for probably twenty minutes watching him, and we
had perfected all the arrangements for a most difficult stalk,
when, with an abrupt movement, he turned his head towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the north, only the tips of his horns appearing above the foliage.
But they were motionless, and I knew that he had seen or
heard something. I turned my head round slowly to look at
my companions, to see whether they had moved, but they lay
as they had dropped, and no sound above a whisper had been
uttered by any of us.</p>

<p>Suddenly the pair of horns swung round to the south, and
the bull’s shoulders appeared in full view as he gave a great
bound forward, disappeared among the bushes, and emerged
galloping his hardest up the ridge, where the jungle was thin,
his tail held erect; next second he had plunged into a watercourse
and disappeared, and a few minutes later we saw his
whole body in the far distance as he made his way heavily up
the steep Gol Adéryu ridge and went down on the other side.
We looked blankly at each other! Of course it was of no use
concealing ourselves now, so we got up and walked to the spot
where the koodoo had been standing; and here, to our disgust,
we met three men and two women of the Esa Musa, who had
come from the Mandeira karias to pick gum. They had been
walking along a torrent-bed and had come close up to the
koodoo before they saw him; and one of the Esa Musa had
thrown his small spear at him and missed, sending the koodoo
off as we had seen.</p>

<p>We enlisted these people in our service by a promise of
meat if successful, and then we slowly took up the tracks.
But we soon lost them again in the rocky ground, and extending
into a line and moving over the ridge where he had disappeared,
we resolved ourselves into couples and searched independently
for further tracks.</p>

<p>We must have spent over an hour doing this, and traversed
about a mile of very steep, stony hills covered with dense thorn
bush, with occasional deep canons and gullies in the limestone,
when one of the gum-pickers ran up and motioned to me to
follow him; and scrambling over another half mile of steep
ground we came upon the tracks of a koodoo, which by their size
I concluded to be those of the bull we had lately lost. He had
slowed down into a walk, the tracks leading up to a very high
ridge, and we took them over the top with great caution, hoping
that we might come upon him somewhere in the next valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>We were soon scrambling along the sides of the valley
when Hassan pointed downwards, and I saw the koodoo
rounding a spur a hundred and fifty yards away, and about a
hundred feet below us; and throwing up the rifle I fired just
before he disappeared, the bullet telling loudly, and my men
calling out that he was hit. We got down to where he had
been in a few seconds, and rounding the corner we found him
lying in a bush which had stopped his body as it had rolled
down the hill. The .577 bullet, entering behind the withers,
had driven nearly through him, breaking the spine and killing
him almost instantaneously. All the Somális, of course, began
shaking hands with me across the body to show their delight.
This was a splendid old bull, his massive neck being covered
with scars received in fights with his species, scratches from the
thorn bushes through which he had forced his way, and abrasions
from the rocks where he had fallen. The horns measured 34½ inches
between tips, 37 inches in a straight line from base to
tip, and 49 inches round the spiral.</p>

<p>It was getting late, and a heavy thunder-storm was coming
up from the south,—always a disagreeable experience in these
hills, and especially so in this instance, because I had nothing
on but a thin vest, a pair of <i>khaki</i> drill breeches, and red
rubber tennis shoes with long stockings, the day having been
too hot for climbing steep hills in a coat.</p>

<p>It became intensely cold as the sun set and the rain poured
down, so employing all our knives we soon whipped off the
skin of the koodoo, and I threw it over my shivering shoulders
like a shawl, hair inside. The Somalis had their tobes. We
cut off the grand head, taking care to leave plenty of the skin
of the neck and beard; and each of us being loaded with head,
meat, or rifles, made our way over the hills back to camp,
arriving an hour after dark; Hassan, who had pointed me out
the koodoo, being privileged to sing the hunting-song as we
approached the camp fire.</p>

<p>During the next six days I went after koodoo morning and
evening without success, sometimes going up into the mountains
before dawn and not returning till after nightfall, and shifting
camp from one watering-place to another.</p>

<p>On the sixth day I had a long hunt after a koodoo with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
fine horns, which we had got news of in Harka-weina in the
Henweina valley; we saw the koodoo across a gorge, and after
making a long détour to get into a favourable position for a
stalk, we found that he had mysteriously disappeared.</p>

<p>On the same evening we marched five miles across the
Henweina valley, and made our bivouac at the karia of one
Waiss Mahomed, of the Adan Esa, Esa Musa, Habr Awal.
The people here were very kind and attentive to me, bringing
me willingly goats, sheep, and milk to buy whenever I wanted
supplies. The camp was pitched among large, flat-topped <i>gudá</i>
thorn-trees hung with thick masses of <i>armo</i> creeper, which forms
a deep and cool shade, and has a light green, heart-shaped
leaf, thick and rubber-like and full of sap. At a distance of a
mile on every side of the camp were the foothills of Gólis
Range. The spot was pleasant, and I resolved to make a halt
of several days here, looking for koodoo and making up the
bundles of specimens ready to be enclosed in boxes when I
arrived at Aden, and sent to Mr. Rowland Ward in London.
This halt was a great rest for the men after the incessant marching
of the last four months, and they thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>

<p>On 12th June I sent out two parties to look for koodoo,
and waited in camp till 10 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span> for news from these men, or
from the Esa Musa cowboys who were herding cattle on the
mountains. A herd-boy brought in news that he had seen four
bull koodoos together on the top of a mountain, about three
miles away, and fifteen hundred feet above camp. After a very
toilsome climb, the day being exceptionally hot, the herd-boy
led us to a saddle in the hills where he had last seen the four
bulls; and as he took us with the wind by mistake, we only
heard the rattle of stones as the game galloped away; we found
their tracks, but never came up with them. Much disappointed,
we descended by the most stony goat-track which I remember
to have traversed at any time, and we arrived in camp very
much done up.</p>

<p>I had just thrown myself on my camel-mats to rest when
Géli and Hassan came in triumphantly with news of another
bull in the opposite direction, about two miles away, and not
more than five hundred feet above our camp. They had seen
him quietly walking over the top of a hill, picking here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
there at the bushes, and without waiting to find out where he
had gone, they had rushed to camp to see whether I had returned
from the other four bulls. I thought no more of rest, and trotted
up the valley with my men, by sheep-paths winding through the
thick undergrowth of aloes, and gained the base of the hill
where the koodoo had been seen. There was not much time
to be lost in searching for his tracks, as it was now half-past
five, and the sun was nearly setting; so having lost them on
stony ground near where he had last been seen, we all went in
different directions to search, Géli and Hassan running about
on top of the hill, and I waiting below under a screen of <i>armo</i>
creeper which hung from a <i>gudá</i> thorn-tree. After a long
wait Géli and Hassan could be seen coming cautiously towards
me down a spur of the hill close to a deep, densely-wooded little
ravine, which ran down parallel to the spur on my left.
Gaining the level of the valley, and creeping from one thicket
to another between the aloes, they at length reached me and
pointed to a dense clump of bushes which grew half-way up
the ravine, two hundred feet above me. We made a circuitous
stalk by a long detour to the right, and so round the top of
the hill on the farther side, and down over the head of the
ravine; but this took so long that when we stalked in on the
clump of bushes from above, the koodoo was no longer there,
the tracks showing that he had grazed away down the hill;
the bottom of this was now concealed from us by the curve
of the steep ground and by the high grass, bushes, and
rocks.</p>

<p>As we looked down the ravine we saw that to our right
the valley fell from the level of my former watching-place into
a V-shaped gorge, running off at right angles to the ravine.
Creeping round the shoulder of the hill to the right, so as to
be just above this gorge, we descended yard by yard, placing
each foot carefully on the rocks and undergrowth so as to avoid
making the slightest sound. The wind was in our faces as we
advanced, and whenever I could get a piece of rock large
enough to stand upon, and see over the high <i>durr</i> grass below,
I slowly raised myself to an erect position, expecting to see
the koodoo and get a shot. This manœuvre had been repeated
three times, cautiously, so that no sound or brusque movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
on our parts should attract the attention of the koodoo, if he
should by any chance be in the gorge below.</p>

<p>As we gained the fourth group of rocks we heard the
rattle of stones and crash of bushes, and saw, from behind, the
horns of the koodoo rising and falling amongst the tufts of
grass as he plunged down into the gorge. He paused before
reaching the bottom, and we were having a whispered argument
whether two objects showing motionless above the grass were
the tips of his horns or spears of aloe, when they moved, and
he went crashing on again.</p>

<p>Knowing he would have to ascend the opposite side of the
V-shaped gorge, as the bushes and aloes were too thick for him
to go fast along the bottom of the V to right or left, I jumped
on to the rock and waited; springing across, he cantered
clumsily up the other side, which was very steep. The distance
was two hundred yards across the gorge, and taking a full sight
I held the rifle for the withers and pulled the trigger. He fell
back among the rocks and bushes, and though still breathing
he was practically dead; but to prevent his moving and
damaging his beautiful horns by rolling among the boulders, I
gave him another shot. The horns measured 50 inches round the
curve, 35½ inches in a straight line from base to tip, and 26½
inches between tips.</p>

<p>On 13th June I took a camel and a few necessaries for spending
the night away from camp; and after looking for koodoo all
day we arrived at a lovely little burn half buried in reeds, at
the base of Banyéro Mountain, which is between six thousand
and six thousand five hundred feet high. This was a charming
spot, a clear stream flowing over boulders of many colours, there
being occasionally narrow stretches of red sand, on which were
imprinted the fresh tracks of koodoo and lion. Above, on the
side of Banyéro Mountain, was a precipice two hundred feet or
so in height, and on the smooth, perpendicular face of this were
a number of holes and cracks leading into the rock, each
tenanted by a group of gray-maned, dog-faced baboons, their
long tails hanging down perpendicularly against the precipice.
The crowded clusters of baboons, of a blue-gray colour, constantly
moving their heads, tails, or legs, and chattering at us,
formed a curious and lively picture against the brick-red face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of the rock. There must have been three hundred altogether,
including the little ones, which clung to the rocks or to their
mothers’ backs; and with all heads looking at us, they kept
up a tremendous barking as we crossed the stream, and it
continued all night close to our bivouac, so that it was a long
time before we were able to get any sleep. Some of the males
seemed as large as retriever dogs, with gray manes as imposing
as that of the lion.</p>

<p>Next morning we had to pass these baboons as we ascended
a gorge to watch for koodoo, and they ran round to the head
of the gully in a small army, like little men determined to
block our passage. They hid in the rocks across our path,
chattering at us as we came on, and when we were fifty yards
away they still sat ferociously watching us. One gray old
fellow had his head looking over a stone, and pointing my
Martini-Henry at it, I was amused to see him duck behind a
rock exactly as a man would have done. I again raised the
rifle and down went his head again. This was curious, for he
had certainly never seen a rifle before. My men stormed the
pass, intent on catching a young one, but they were too quick
for us, and retired slowly up the ravine, disputing with their
short angry bark every inch of the ground. Of course I did
not fire at the human-looking brutes; and the Somális, approving,
said that they were little men, and it was unlucky to
kill them.</p>

<p>In the forenoon we saw three cow koodoos and a young bull
with half-grown horns, grazing up a patch of green meadow grass
in a valley several hundred feet below us; but after watching
them for an hour, and seeing that no old bull joined them, we
gave it up for the day, and prepared for the long journey back
to the main camp. As we descended to our bivouac to pack
up our blankets and cooking-pots, we gave these koodoos a
slant of our wind, and one of the females stood pawing the
ground and looking up at us, both of the huge rounded ears
held forward. We did not move, and every minute or so she
emitted a loud bark which went echoing up the hillsides.</p>

<p>This alarm-note is given by an old cow when she scents or
sees danger, but cannot quite make out its nature, and so she
calls the attention of the herd. Sometimes three or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
females on hearing the bark of one will throw up their heads,
and joining her will stand motionless, all eyes turned to the
direction of danger, as if in council, and then they canter away,
followed by the ruck of the herd. By remaining motionless,
even if on the bare hillside, you may keep up this performance
for any length of time; but once you move, having made you
out, off they go. More than once I have been first warned of the
presence of koodoo in a valley below me by the loud echoing
bark coming across to me from half a mile away, and arresting
ourselves as if turned to stone, we have searched the opposite
slopes, and have at last made out three or four brown bodies,
standing under the shade of an overhanging precipice, in colour
so like the background that we should never have seen them
but for that warning bark. The old doe is usually a splendid
sentry, but often she betrays the herd in this way.</p>

<p>On the 14th we came back to our former bivouac at the reed-margined
spring, hoping to see the herd again in the morning,
perhaps accompanied by an old bull. We arrived late, and
found the baboons again in force. We lit fires and threw ourselves
down under a fig-tree for the night. This was a very
picturesque night camp. The stream was just below us, giving
out a murmuring of running water which was refreshing after
the hot march of the day. An hour after the sun had gone
down a crescent moon rose in the east, and just disappearing
in the west, following the sun, blazing in the clear mountain
air, was the <i>Hedig wa Galab</i>, or evening star.</p>

<p>The two goats which I had brought to supply milk for my
morning coffee were standing against each other, head to tail,
between the two fires, trying to keep warm in spite of a current
of air which blew down from the higher gorges of Banyéro,
where the mist hung very white, shreds of it clinging to the
side ravines and round the shoulders of the mountain. Between
the fires, and around the goats, lay coiled the four natives.
The camel sat alone, a little farther out, chewing the cud with
regular cadence of sound and gazing into the darkness, its large
eyes reflecting the firelight. The baboons kept up their barking
all night as on the former occasion, and next morning were seen
crossing the top of an adjacent cliff, inspecting our camp.</p>

<p>The next day we hunted for koodoo all the morning, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
only once more saw the same family of cows with the half-grown
bull; so we made for the Henweina camp, and arrived
in the afternoon, very thirsty. Géli, while taking care of my
water-bottle, smashed it against a projecting rock, losing the
day’s supply.</p>

<p>This march home was twice as long as it need have been;
for, anxious to visit the higher parts of Banyéro, I had
ascended a thousand feet to the Mirso ledge, and walking for
several miles between splendid specimens of the mountain cedar,
I had again descended into the Henweina Valley near the main
camp, by a sheep track which we hit upon, hitherto unknown
to the guides. I continued unsuccessful during the next few
days, going many a “wild-goose chase” after some bull which
some one had seen, and when away after this, a splendid chance
in another direction would be lost through my being out of
camp. What sometimes occurred was that three shepherds
would see a koodoo while out in the early morning tending
sheep, and leaving one of their number to mind the sheep and
to watch the koodoo at the same time, the other two would run
down to camp, over four miles of mountain and valley, to bring
me the news. By the time I had arrived at the spot, perhaps
some hours afterwards, the man who had been left to watch
would either be asleep or would have moved with his sheep to
another pasture; and while we looked for the koodoo in the
absence of a guide, it would catch sight of us and steal away.
I think I never worked harder than at this period in the search
for koodoo, but was continually disappointed, often going three
expeditions during the day, and climbing many thousands of
feet.</p>

<p>One day we heard a fine leopard coughing, as leopards do,
among the hills, and I spent the day looking for his cave.
Arriving home after dark, the first object which I saw on
approaching the camp fire was the spotted body, with a framing
of natives, who had just brought him over from the Esa Musa
karia quite close to us. The elders, having lost a goat the
night before, had on this evening tied one up as a bait, and
had prepared a running noose of camel-rope in the brushwood
of the zeríba through which he must pass to get to the goat.
Having sauntered boldly down from the hills in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
for another goat, as had been his custom, he charged recklessly
and got himself noosed, when the Somális, who had been waiting
in ambush, closed round and speared him. The body was
scarcely cold when I bought it of old Waiss Mahomed, the
patriarch of the karia, for twelve rupees.</p>

<p>The koodoos seemed to have left this neighbourhood. I
had heard a good deal in Henweina about a mysterious bull
koodoo living in the high Massleh Wein gully, overlooking
Garbadir, fifteen miles to the east along the foot of Gólis, if one
went round by the camel path, or nine miles up and down, if one
took a short cut over the mountains. He was known to have
remained in Massleh Wein, drinking nightly at the spring below,
for three years. He was reported to be very old and cunning,
to carry enormous horns, and to be lame in one foot. He had
been seen by a great many shepherds in the same place, but
had always at once disappeared in the mists which filled these
gorges in the early morning; and the clump of cedar-trees,
amongst which he was always found, being on the spur between
the bifurcation of two branches of the Massleh gully, he had
from his lair a view in every direction.</p>

<p>Having resolved to try conclusions with this bull, I sent my
caravan round the base of a peaked mountain called Hambeileh
Weina, by a good camel track, with orders to the men in charge
to make two marches to Garbadir, and camp at Armáleh water.
Armáleh to the east and Massleh to the west were two of several
valleys which joined to form the district called Garbadir. The
grazing grounds of Garbadir, filling a semicircle of about six
miles’ radius, formed a bay in Gólis Range, under Daar Ass
Bluff, which is about six thousand five hundred feet above the
sea. Garbadir was beautifully wooded with very large <i>gudá</i>
thorn forest, plenty of grass growing in the glades, and the
ground was covered with fresh tracks of the Esa Musa flocks.
It was at Armáleh Garbadir that I had formed my first shooting
camp in 1885.</p>

<p>From my Henweina camp into Garbadir there was a short
cut over the mountains which was impassable for camels, and
this path I took with my two gunbearers and an Esa Musa
guide, ascending and descending about a thousand feet over
the neck between the Hambeileh Weina pointed peak and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
top of Daar Ass. At a height of about five thousand feet above
the sea we found several Esa Musa cattle karias, perched on the
mountains, with splendid flat stretches of open green pasture.
The Esa Musa herds showed me the tracks of a very large
koodoo, which I knew to be those of a well-known bull which
I had hunted once or twice during the last few days, and which
we had called the Darei-Hosei koodoo, after the name of the
gully in which he was generally seen by the shepherds in the
early mornings; but as he had passed by at dawn, several
hours before, I held on for the Armáleh camp, leaving Massleh
Valley two miles behind us on my right.</p>

<p>I resolved not to disturb Massleh gorge till we should hear
news of the well-known Massleh koodoo. Arriving at Armáleh
a little after noon, I sent some Esa Musa shepherds up to
Massleh with orders to sit on points of vantage and watch the
gorge for the appearance of the koodoo when he should get up
from his sleep in the afternoon; and if they should see him,
to run and let me know; meanwhile I sat down and waited
for the caravan to come round by the long road.</p>

<p>At about four o’clock, acting on the information of an old
woman who was collecting firewood, I went after pig, and
came to the Massleh water; we here found several women and
girls filling their bark water-vessels preparatory to carrying
them on their backs to their huts; and they told us they had
just seen a large wart-hog boar come to drink, and then run
away again without drinking. Following on the tracks, we
came suddenly on him twenty yards away on the top of a rise
in a goat path, and I raised my rifle and covered his shoulder;
but finding I could not see his tusks, and as I never shoot a
boar unless they are abnormally large, I let him off. He
walked round the bend of the path and I followed, but coming
to the corner we found he had managed to go quietly away
without leaving a track to show his whereabouts.</p>

<p>My gunbearer said he must be a <i>shaitan</i>, or devil, and we
were just preparing to drink and go home when two Esa Musa
ran up to say they had seen the lame koodoo of Massleh Wein,
and they could show him to me at once! This was great luck!
We started off at a trot up the Lower Massleh Valley, and came
to where there was a stretch of about half a mile, before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
branched out in the form of a Y into two gorges running up
steeply into Daar Ass Mountain. The natives had just seen
him coming out of the mass of jungle which filled the point
of junction of the two gorges where they joined to form the
main valley, or stalk of the Y, lower down.</p>

<p>Géli and I, keeping to the right, ascended the side of the
valley and sat down under the shade of a black poison-bush on
a pile of rocks, commanding the nearest of the two small gorges
above the junction, that is, the western one; while I stopped the
eastern gorge by sending an Esa Musa across to its head, to
drive back the koodoo should he attempt to retreat up it. We
knew he was somewhere in the jungle below the junction of the
gorges, and I had ordered Hassan and the other Esa Musa to
sit under cover down in the lower valley long enough to give
us all time to take up our appointed positions; and then, when
they saw us posted, to walk slowly up through the jungle,
looking for the fresh tracks.</p>

<p>I had been sitting some twenty minutes at my post, when
Hassan and the Esa Musa shouted across from the jungle to
the men at the head of the eastern gorge to look out, and we
saw the koodoo, the finest I have ever set eyes on, go cantering
heavily upwards along the bank of the torrent-bed which occupied
the centre of the eastern gorge. The men whom I had
posted there shouted back, and the koodoo, as I expected,
made for the western gorge which was commanded by my rifle.</p>

<p>On the opposite side of this gully, on a level with the bush
under which I was sitting, was a very large <i>gudá</i> tree, and the
range to this tree I judged to be about two hundred yards
across the gorge. If I allowed him to pass this tree I knew
that my chances of bagging him would become very slender, as
the gorge widened, and there was a way by which he could get
out of it, over a shoulder of the mountain, without again coming
within range.</p>

<p>It became very exciting listening to the shouts from the
jungle below and the answering shouts from the other gorge,
and more so as, warned by the rattle of displaced stones and
the crashing of bushes, I turned my eyes and saw the koodoo at
the point of intersection of the two gorges, and heading straight
for the one which I commanded. I had in my hands a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
military Martini-Henry, and pushing forward the sliding-leaf
to two hundred yards I marked the <i>gudá</i> tree opposite and
watched. There was suspense for a moment or two, and then
with another crash he emerged from the jungle and galloped
along the opposite hillside, straight for the <i>gudá</i> tree. I held
for the front of his shoulder, just clear of his body, and as he
neared the tree I fired. Looking under the smoke I observed
him still galloping on, and felt in my pocket for another
cartridge; but after passing the tree he suddenly plunged
forward and went rolling over and over down the hill, till his
body was arrested about thirty feet below by a bush, and then
he lay motionless. We made very short time across the rocky
gorge, and coming up I found him dead, the Martini picket
having passed through his heart—a wonderfully lucky shot at
the distance.</p>

<p class="caption">Rock Rabbits</p>
</div>

<p>He was a splendid sight as he lay extended on the remains
of the bush into which he had crashed, his horns measuring
52 inches and 53 inches respectively round the curve, and
3 feet 1 inch in a straight line from base to tip, and 37
inches between tips; and his massive neck was adorned with a
fine white and brown beard. There was a slight malformation
in the hoof of his right foreleg which accounted for his lameness,
but did not much interfere with his speed when galloping.</p>

<p>We carried his head back to camp in the dusk, leaving
three men to skin him; and we sent back all the Esa Musa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
whom we could collect in the valley below on our way to camp,
telling them to go up and scramble for the meat.</p>

<p>Having now bagged three good bull koodoos in three weeks,
which is about the usual rate of successful and lucky koodoo
stalking in these mountains, and my leave being up, I went in
three short marches to Berbera, and a week later caught a
steamer to Aden.</p>

<p>During the first trip to the Webbe we had been four and a
half months in the interior, travelling over more than eleven
hundred miles of camel track. I found at Aden that an extension
of leave had been granted, and at once prepared a second caravan,
intending to go back to Imé, and taking Gabba Oboho at his
word, to explore Gállaland and the Juba under his guidance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>On 30th July ’93 we landed again at Berbera with thirty-four
men armed with Snider carbines and forty-five fresh camels.
The coast men were very much afraid of Gállaland, and insisted
that we ought to have at least a hundred rifles; but fighting
not being my object, I considered our party strong enough, and
after explaining that I would only cross the Gálla border if the
Gállas should prove peaceful, the men took a more cheerful view
of the prospects of my journey.</p>

<p>We marched from Berbera on 31st July, and on the second
day we passed Lord Delamere and his shooting party on their
way to the coast. Captain Abud was at that time encamped
at Hargeisa, carrying on political business with Eidegalla chiefs.
Sheikh Mattar of Hargeisa, whom I met here, advised me not to
go to Imé, but to try Karanleh, three marches farther down the
Webbe; and he gave me an Arabic letter to Seyyid Mahomed,
a mullah whose permanent town lay in our front. By visiting
the Seyyid I should cross Ogádén by a route several days to
the west of my former one through Dagaha-Madóba.</p>

<p>I crossed the Haud by the Warda Gumaréd, the route we
had taken on our first crossing, when I had gone to Milmil
with my brother the year before; this time I carried water for
five and a half days only. About three marches out from
Hargeisa I crossed the fresh tracks of seventy-five horsemen of
the Abdalla Saad, Habr Awal, who had gone to loot the Eidegalla
a few hours before my caravan passed over the ground.</p>

<p>Crossing the Rer Ali and Rer Harún tribes, always friendly,
on the 16th I arrived at Seyyid Mahomed’s town. It is a
permanent village of three or four hundred huts, about the
size of Hargeisa, its site being near the Tug Fáfan, in the
Malingúr tribe. The banks of the stream, which we found
dry, were dotted with thriving and very extensive patches of
<i>jowári</i> cultivation. The inhabitants are mainly widads and
mullahs from different Somáli tribes.</p>

<p>Pitching camp under some shady trees near the river, on
the Fáfan banks, I went with the elders, through a dense crowd,
to the Seyyid’s hut. He was too old and feeble to walk over
to camp, and had sent his son to ask me if I would mind coming
to him, to make his acquaintance and give him medicine. The
Seyyid is known far and wide as a holy man, even my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Dolbahanta headman, Adan Yusuf, having heard of him. Adan
was glad to meet such a holy man, who was said to be invulnerable.
He added that the Abyssinians lately tied the Seyyid up and
fired at him point blank with Remingtons, but the bullets melted;
they then bound him to a <i>gudá</i> thorn-tree, and collecting all the
dry branches about, they lit a roaring fire at his feet, but he obstinately
refused to burn; so then they gave up interfering with him!</p>

<p>If he were a fighting man the Seyyid would probably have
developed into a first-class Mahdi, and long ere this he could
have made a combined movement against Abyssinia; but his
influence, like that of other Somáli sheikhs and mullahs, is
almost entirely social and religious. He lives a quiet life,
cultivating <i>jowári</i>, reading the Koran, and educating youths.
Among the nomad tribes the fighting elders abound, but they
have not the wide influence of these cosmopolitan Mahomedan
priests, and, moreover, there is no element of cohesion among
them, each working for the good of his own clan and ignoring
the general interests of the community. The Seyyid was cordial,
and I gave him medicine at the door of his hut in the presence
of his wives and children, who squatted on their heels in a semicircle
around us, whilst the townspeople collected in a dense
mass to gaze at us through the palisades of the courtyard
which separated the hut from the main street of the village.
He had only seen one English party, that of Colonel Paget
and Lord Wolverton, two months before, and they had left a
very good impression; not so the caravan under Prince Ruspoli,
for he, less fortunate, had had a good deal of trouble with
the natives in Gállaland, on the Webbe, and even in Somáliland.
I mention this because the troubles of this Italian
caravan had an adverse influence over the success of my trip.</p>

<p>Before we left the hut of the sick man he had written for
me an Arabic letter to Hussein-bin-Khalaf and Núr Róbleh,
the two Mahomedan chiefs of Karanleh. While we were halted
at the Fáfan, crowds of sick people and cripples from the
village constantly loitered in and about camp, begging for
medical treatment from <i>ninki frinji wein</i> (the great foreigner).<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
Every European being believed to be a doctor, they rushed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
me for treatment, presenting the most complicated diseases, such
as cataract in the eye and cancer. My medicine bag containing
only chlorodyne, pills, vaseline, quinine, and the simplest medicines,
I treated what cases I could, and sent the worst away with a
small present of meat or calico and a few comforting words, which
were listened to in dead silence by the crowd of relations.</p>

<p>At the Seyyid’s village I heard that Ugáz Umr, the Malingúr
chief, had returned from Harar, after laying complaints against
frontier Abyssinians before Rás Makunan. Eight men, who
had either deserted from Prince Ruspoli or had been dismissed
by him, said that some of their comrades and all the guns had
been seized by Ugáz Umr, and were to be sent to Harar. They
asked me to interfere; but for political reasons I declined.</p>

<p>On 22nd August, at sunset, we reached Bokhaiyer, another
permanent village, occupied by the Rer Amáden tribe. Here
I met many old friends, among them Jáma Deria and his sons,
who had escorted me to Imé a few months before, and were in
this country on a short visit. I was standing about, the centre of
a mob of the villagers, when Jáma Deria and six horsemen rode
up, covering us with dust, and Jáma shouted that “his Englishman
had come.” He took jealous care of me, whipping away
the crowd, and never ceased begging till I left next morning.</p>

<p>After several days’ hard marching we reached the Webbe
at Sen Morettu, a permanent village of the Gilimiss Somális,
standing on the north bank, about six marches south-east of
Imé, Karanleh lying half-way between the two villages.</p>

<p>In this journey, owing to the great difficulty in getting
reliable guides, we had made a détour to the east, doing fifty-two
marches between Berbera and the Webbe, the direct distance
being forty short marches. We actually struck the Webbe at
Dagah-Yeleh on 25th August, and in the evening I went out
and shot my first adult <i>balanka</i>, or waterbuck. Both the bucks
I had shot at Imé, under the impression that they belonged to
a new species, I now found to be only young ones.</p>

<p>Next day we made one long march westward, by the river
banks, to Sen Morettu. The Gilimiss Somális were strong here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and came in numbers to my camp to present their salaams.
Late at night they brought for sale the skin of a <i>dól</i>, or Webbe
bushbuck. This was the first time I had heard of such a thing
as a <i>dól</i>, and I resolved not to leave the Webbe till I had shot
one. I got a very large crocodile by moonlight; it was floating
with the eyes above the water, only thirty yards from the tent,
no doubt waiting for one of the milch goats to come and drink.</p>

<p>This night camp on the banks of the Webbe at Sen Morettu
was striking in its scenery, and will ever live in my memory.
The Gilimiss who had brought the <i>dól</i> skin had left, and
the camp had settled down into slumber, except for one
watchful sentry. The moonlight was so bright that everything
had a distinctive colour, the sky being of a deep blue,
studded with stars in the regions farthest from the moon.
I went to the river bank and looked out on the water gliding
by, in streaks of silver and dark brown, across the shadows
of the tall casuarina-trees,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> which rose one hundred and twenty
yards away on the opposite bank. Several of the trunks
had fallen, and lay aslant upon the steep bank of the river.
Now and then a gust of wind swept with a peculiar roaring
sound through the feathery tree-tops, and ruffled the surface of
the water with broad patches of silver as it blew across to our
camp. Sometimes monkeys chattered, or squirrels shrieked,
disturbed by prowling animals in the dense evergreen bush,
bordering the river. Each movement I made was the signal for
the splash of one or two crocodiles as they regained the water.</p>

<p>Glancing into the camp, I could see, in the bright moonlight,
men and animals lying in different positions, as if they
had been suddenly struck down by sleep. Adan’s horse lay
by the cook’s fire fast asleep, with his head against a camel-saddle,
and on the other side of the glowing embers were
Suleiman the cook and three white milch goats, lying close
together. The forty-five camels were sitting on their hard
nether humps packed close, with tails to the wind, steadily
chewing the cud, their eyes flashing with quiet enjoyment; for
this is the only time when they are not pestered by flies, and
they evidently deem it far too valuable to be thrown away entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
in sleep; though occasionally, for a short spell, the head and
neck will be laid stretched out flat along the ground and the
eyes closed. All around were lying camel-trunks, water-casks,
bags of rice, and mountains of camel-mats, piled in the form of
a rough circular wall, enclosing the camels; and taking shelter
from the wind between these and the camels were the sleeping
men, scattered in twos and threes, with their rifles by their sides.
The bright light threw deep black shadows on the short grass;
we were in a glade a quarter of a mile wide, bordered by a
fringe of tall casuarina-trees. At the edge of the glade, up
stream and near the river bank, a deserted village of large beehive
huts of brown straw stood out against the gray, indistinct
background of the trees. Large logs of driftwood and snags,
with half their length out of the water and looking very black,
gave one the impression of crocodiles; and certain pairs of
gray dots, sometimes disappearing and again reappearing a few
yards away, resembling pieces of driftwood, were really the
projecting lumps on the heads of crocodiles, which were
floating with the eyes just above the water, looking out for
prey.</p>

<p>The climate at Sen Morettu was perfect for sleeping out,
and I found myself regretting that before two months were
over I should have to leave this interesting river, and almost
certainly never get a chance of seeing it again.</p>

<p>We marched to Maaruf, a landing-stage exactly opposite to
Karanleh, which was on the south side of the river. We passed
through numbers of the Gilimiss people, who said they had
come to the north bank for fear of the Gállas, who were out
raiding. The camels had been late in getting off from Sen
Morettu, so I walked on with the two shikáris. We found
several of the Gilimiss elders at the landing-stage, and had a
long talk about the means of getting across, while sitting under
some very large trees which gave a welcome shelter from the
midday sun. The Webbe was rather low, the width being only
ninety yards. The people occupying the banks were Gilimiss
Somális and Adone, or Webbe negroes.</p>

<p>The Gilimiss cultivate on both sides of the river when not
in fear of the Arussi (Geríré) Gállas, who live in the hills ten
miles away to the south, and often raid along the south bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
The Gálla name for the Webbe is Webbe Sidáma; no one calls
it Webbe Shabéleh here. Shabéleh (“the place of leopards”) is
merely the name of the district farther down to the south-east,
where Mr. F. L. James and his companions first struck the
river in 1884. Since that journey no Englishman had visited
the Webbe till the previous spring, when my own caravan and
that of Colonel Paget reached it simultaneously, as I found on
my return to Berbera in June.</p>

<p>I sent one of the Gilimiss into Karanleh to call Hussein-bin-Khalaf
and Núr Róbleh, and to present my Arabic letter. The
first chief was sick, but Núr Róbleh sent word to say he would
come over to see me in the evening. Meanwhile I went to
look for bushbuck in the thick belt of forest along the margin
of the river.</p>

<p>On first arriving at the landing-stage I had been met by a
rival of Núr Róbleh, who undertook to take my caravan across
on rafts made of dried tree-trunks. But Núr Róbleh, arriving
on the scene while I was away hunting, arrested the other chief
and his partisans, and tied them all up at the foot of a tree,
placing one of my escort on guard over them with a loaded
rifle. However, when I walked into camp, much to Núr Róbleh’s
disgust, I set them free.</p>

<p>The Amáden and Gilimiss told me it would take seven
days to cross; but before leaving Aden I had bought sixty
fathoms of three-inch rope. This we made fast to bollards
driven deep into the mud on both sides of the river, and pulling
the rope taut we attached two of the native rafts to it by running
loops, so that they could be easily hauled backwards and forwards;
this was a great improvement on the primitive way of
punting and paddling the rafts across the swift current and
landing four hundred yards below the shoving-off point By
this method, instead of seven days, it took us only one day for
the baggage and one day for the animals, all the latter swimming
over; the more timid of the camels were bound and towed over
by a crowd of swimming men, shouting and splashing to keep off
the crocodiles, while I fired a blank cartridge now and then from
the bank. I also shot two crocodiles, one a very large one. It
lay dead on an island, and four small boys jumped into the
river, and swimming to the island, towed the carcase to the bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
The natives are in the habit of swimming their horses and cattle
across when moving to better pasture. We saw one negro
family, including women, children, mats, cooking pots, and all
their effects, moving across on a raft so overloaded that half of
them were sitting in six inches of water. Where cows drink,
the natives construct brushwood semicircular fences to enclose
the shallows and so deter the crocodiles from attacking the
animals; yet, despite all precautions, the loss caused by crocodiles
is very great.</p>

<p>By the evening of 29th August our camp was properly
established on the southern bank, and we were on the Gálla
side of the border. At night Núr Róbleh returned to me.
I had sent him out to look for Dubbi Harré and Gudan
Abatteri, two Arussi Gálla chiefs of great influence, to whom
Seyyid Mahomed had written a letter on my behalf. He now
came with news of one of these. He had given the letter to
Dubbi Harré, who was now staying in a village five miles to
the south-east, owned by a rich Somáli named Yahia; and
Dubbi Harré had unexpectedly said that his own tribe and all
the Gállas had had serious difficulties with the Prince’s caravan
which was in front of me, these being the first Europeans they
had ever seen, and they wished no more white men to enter their
country, adding, if I still wished to see him, I might send soldiers
to take him, but he would have gone to Gállaland. He feared
to come to camp lest I should have him flogged, for he
believed all Europeans were bad, and only invited people to
visit them in order to make them prisoners. The first party of
Europeans whose acquaintance he had made had said they meant
peace, and had made war. Of course I took his statements
regarding this caravan to be very one-sided and, because advanced
by a native, probably untrue.</p>

<p>Knowing that Prince Ruspoli had pushed through to the far
interior of Gállaland with about one hundred and twenty rifles,
and that they had lost a great many men in one way and
another, I did not hope that my party, consisting of a single white
man, with only thirty followers and with limited time, would be
able to force its way through the tribes which my predecessors
had already passed, should they be hostile to us. Fighting,
except in self-defence, was not part of my programme, as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
had promised the men at Berbera; I meant, if possible, to
enter the country by the invitation of the natives or not
at all.</p>

<p>I gave Núr Róbleh some calico and a Koran, telling him
to ride quickly to Dubbi Harré and give him the presents, and
to assure him that if he would come to my camp he would
have safe conduct, and be hospitably entertained, and free to
go when he liked. After an interval of twenty-four hours,
during which I hunted unsuccessfully for <i>dól</i>, Núr Róbleh
returned with better news. He had found Dubbi Harré on the
point of leaving for the mountains; but, the presents softening
him, the Gálla chief had promised to come to me, though he
protested that it would be of no use; he had declared he
would never be able to persuade his countrymen that there
could be any good in me.</p>

<p>On the morning of 30th August six horsemen came in.
There were three Somális, Yahia and two friends, and three
Gállas, Dubbi Harré being one of them. Dubbi Harré was
a remarkably handsome and pleasant-looking old man, clean
shaven, with thin, well-cut features. Taking Dubbi Harré by the
hand I led them into the tent, in which had been arranged on
the right and left rows of boxes covered with folded blankets;
there was also a box for myself against the tent pole, and a mat
on the ground for Adan Yusuf, the interpreter. As usual, we
began the conference with coffee.</p>

<p>Dubbi Harré said that his country had been peaceable and
happy till Europeans had come a few months ago; but that
they and the Abyssinians had brought in rifles, and had
fought; and now the people were firmly resolved to allow
no one into the land who carried firearms or were escorted
by men so armed.</p>

<p>I contended that I had come as a friend. He answered,
“Yes, the other white men said that too.” Without going into
the rights and wrongs of the case, it seemed to me that the
caravan which had gone before me had been singularly unfortunate
in the impression left behind, and I thought, that
being the case, in the limited period of my leave it would
be at least very uphill work ingratiating myself. I did my
best, however, and Dubbi Harré and I became good friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
over our coffee. He said he had seen my men as he came
into camp; he liked the look of them; they were well behaved
and orderly; they were clean and respectable Mahomedans
and few in number, and altogether different from the
rabble of Abyssinians, Arabs, and Soudanese whom the other
Europeans had brought; and now, having seen us, he believed
we wished him no harm. He and his two companions were
no longer afraid to be with us—though he had been afraid,
very much afraid, at first. I told him that if I had come for
war I should have brought more men, and that he, a chief
skilled in fighting, had seen there were only thirty, and could
judge for himself whether we looked like invaders.</p>

<p>Dubbi Harré spoke quietly, with a pleasant smile on his
face. He looked what he was, a fighting chief, of great intelligence.
I said, “What will happen if we go to Wéb, in
your country?” He said his people would fight; I declared
we would hurt no one. He said, “No, but they will hurt you,
and I wish to prevent you going. They are looking for a
white man to kill, because they are angry with your countrymen
the white men, who came first and fought with them. If
your countrymen had not come first we should have received
you well, but now it is different. I believe you, but the tribes
won’t; so take my advice and don’t go. You will find game
in the empty country between the Aulihán Somális and the
Geríré Gállas; there are elephants and giraffes; you can get
Yahia here to arrange your trip. If, however, you persist in
wishing to go to the Webbe Wéb, I will go on and tell my
people, and will come back, and if I think it safe I will take
you there myself.”</p>

<p>Attracted by the prospect of shooting buffaloes and hippopotami,
which were to be found at the Wéb, and not in the
Aulihán country, I stuck to my idea of going into Gállaland,
declaring that I had not come all this way to see Somális.
So it was arranged we should go to the Aulihán for eleven
days; and then, returning to Karanleh, meet Dubbi Harré,
and be taken by him to the Webbe Wéb. This matter
having been settled, Dubbi Harré and his friends remained my
guests till the cool of the evening, and then rode away with
Yahia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>At sunrise, on 31st August, I broke up the Karanleh camp
and marched through some five miles of <i>jowári</i> plantations,
near the south bank of the river, to Yahia’s village, where I
shot a noted man-eating crocodile. These hideous pests swarm
here; once I shot a wild goose, which, falling into the stream,
was at once seized by a crocodile and drawn under while still
struggling. In the evening we made another march to a spot
near the river where we had been told to expect a school of
hippopotami, and I shot two good waterbuck bulls on the way
there. We saw fresh tracks of the hippos in the reeds, and
I sat up by moonlight in the jungle overlooking them, hoping
to bag one as it came to feed on shore. But at 4 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, finding
nothing stirring in the reeds, we gave it up and returned to
camp by moonlight. The Gilimiss, our guide, said that the
hippopotami were scarce and wary, as the Adone negroes,
during a recent famine, when nearly all their cattle had died
of disease, had killed hippopotami for food, and had greatly
reduced their numbers.</p>

<p>The great epidemic of cattle disease which three or four
years ago raged in Masailand, and other parts of East
Africa was also felt in Ogádén, the cattle and the koodoo
antelopes dying of it in large numbers. It was felt as far north
as the Marar Prairie.</p>

<p>We made a morning march on 1st September, and another
in the evening. While passing over ground blackened by fire,
and covered with young grass, I shot a buck Sœmmering’s
gazelle and a waterbuck. At dusk, coming to dense forest by
the river, I ordered the men to pitch camp at the edge, and
entering the jungle unattended, I saw a red object standing
motionless near the stem of a large tree twenty yards away.
I felt certain it was an antelope, but was unable to make it
out in the half light. I put up the rifle and fired, when the
animal rushed past me and fell in a ravine close by, rolling
over on its side; and on going up to it, I found, to my delight,
it was a young buck of the <i>dól</i>, or striped and spotted Webbe
bushbuck, which I had been so anxious to get. Going into
camp to call up the men, I shot a buck lesser koodoo. As the
forest appeared to have plenty of game in it I resolved to halt
for a day’s shooting. The camp was in a very pleasant place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
at the corner of a patch of forest looking down on the river
from the edge of a steep bank.</p>

<p>Next day at dawn I went out and soon came upon a
waterbuck. We had been making for a wide glade of fresh
grass, and on emerging from the forest we caught sight of him
going up a bank two hundred yards away. I fired, and we
ran to the spot, but his tracks leading away without any sign
of blood, I knew I had missed. He took us through several
very thick patches of bush, the game paths sometimes forming
tunnels four feet high in the vegetation; and at last, the light
appearing ahead, we forced our way through a thicket and
found ourselves unexpectedly on the very verge of the Webbe,
a few yards from the water’s edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus35">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="400" height="250" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Waterbuck swimming</p>
</div>

<p>Directly we showed our heads outside the jungle my man
Géli pushed me back and pointed out into the centre of the
stream, which lay before us, flowing deep and swift, a hundred
yards broad; out in the middle appeared the head and horns
of the noble waterbuck swimming for the opposite shore. It
was too good a prize to lose, so, waiting till he shook the
water from his flanks and cantered up the slope of stiff mud,
I fired, and striking him behind the withers brought him down;
and then another shot finished him. In his struggles he had
slipped down the bank to within six feet of the water, and I
was in a great fright lest after all his splendid head should go
to the crocodiles. We ran the three miles back to camp along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the margin of the water, and on reaching it I set all the men
to work, cutting down the trunks of dead dry trees to form a
raft, and by the afternoon it was ready.</p>

<p>Géli and a Gilimiss guide then poled themselves across the
river, and after three hours they returned with the head. I
was so anxious to measure it that I shouted to Géli to place
the horn against his Snider rifle, while I marked another Snider
which my men handed to me, and found that the buck’s horns
could not measure much less than twenty-four inches, a large
pair for the Webbe, where waterbuck horns are comparatively
short. I anxiously watched the men come over with my
specimen, and then I carried it to my tent. At night we had
several alarms, caused by hyænas and lions, the camels rising
suddenly together, running about camp, and stumbling over
tent-ropes in the dark. I remained several days hunting waterbuck
with great success.</p>

<p>While we were encamped here Adan Yusuf’s horse met
with his death in rather a melancholy way. At noon the men
were lying under shady trees round camp, sleeping like hogs,
and I sat in my tent writing up my journal. The camels were
a mile away, browsing under the care of one man, and the horse
and Rás Makunan’s mule were hobbled by tying the near fore
and near hind leg together, according to Somáli custom. The
three milch goats and the horse and mule were allowed to
wander about near camp, the man who usually looked after
them, thinking I had gone to sleep, having retired to the shade
of a tree to do likewise.</p>

<p>About an hour afterwards I heard a loud whinny from the
mule, and looking out of the tent I saw her swimming out
in the middle of the stream, her head bobbing up and down in
the water. She was being carried down fast, so I fired a gun
into the air to wake the men, and we all jumped up and ran to
the edge of the water. There was a perpendicular scarp just
below the site of the camp, where the swift current had undermined
the bank, and towards this she was being carried. We
ran to the beginning of the steep place, and two of the men,
plunging into the river, caught her head as she came on with
the current, and bringing her to the bank, after a hard struggle,
with all hands helping, we landed her high and dry. Examining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
the bank, we found several long streaks in the mud showing
where the mule, while drinking, had slid in; and then we went
to look for Adan’s horse, and a search up and down the river
only disclosed similar marks in the mud farther down stream;
we never saw the horse again, and no doubt the crocodiles got
him. Indeed, hobbled as she was, it was wonderful how the
mule kept above water and it was lucky she had the sense to
whinny, and so attract attention to her accident.</p>

<p>The Gilimiss guide whom we had taken from Karanleh told
me that we should be attacked by the Aulihán if we followed the
river down as far as Burka, and represented the Aulihán to be
very dangerous people. But I found, upon questioning my own
men, that the guide had lately been concerned in the killing of
an Aulihán, and that tribe naturally wanted his blood; so, to
avoid trouble, I dismissed him and went on without a guide.
This was not difficult, because a good native path followed the
course of the river, and we were never so far from the bends
that we could not bring from them, in our casks, the water for
camp use.</p>

<p>On 5th September we arrived at a low precipitous hill
called Burka, shooting a bull oryx on the way. We met some
of the Aulihán who were watering their flocks, and on 6th
September we followed them to their karias, which were some
distance inland. The name of this sub-tribe was Rer Afgab,
Aulihán. They gave us milk and a display on horseback;
and they asked us to go to their country to shoot, stating they
would barter cattle in exchange for cloth, and that if I took
the cattle afterwards to the Gállas in the Wéb country I would
get plenty of ivory.</p>

<p>On 7th September, finding that the giraffe ground was at
least four days to the south of Burka, we marched back towards
Karanleh, to be ready to meet Dubbi Harré on the day appointed.
We made a long march to our old camp at Ellán,
where I had lost the horse, and thence we went to Yahia’s village.
Dubbi Harré had not yet arrived, so we retraced our steps
down the river to shoot for a few days, halting at a place called
Shendil. Our camp was pitched on open ground outside a
belt of forest some four miles long by one mile deep, fringing
the Webbe. On the northern bank, opposite to Shendil, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Sen Morettu, where we had first struck the river a fortnight
before. To the south of us lay an even plain gradually rising
towards the Gálla mountains, being covered in alternate patches
of thick thorn bush and glades of long, coarse, buffalo grass.</p>

<p>The operation of pitching camp was interrupted by a row
between two of my men, one of whom had two fingers broken
by the descending butt of a Snider rifle, which had been intended
for his head. Having held an inquiry, and disarmed
and placed the culprits under supervision at opposite ends of
the camp, to let them cool down, I went out into the thick
bush to the south and had some exciting shooting, getting two
very fine waterbuck.</p>

<p>On the 12th I went out shooting on a wide open plain
which had been cleared by fire, only the leafless trees with
charred stems being left standing above the black ground;
young grass, always very attractive to game, had begun to
spring up, and here I shot two more waterbuck, both carrying
good heads. In the evening, going into the high forest by the
river to look for the <i>dól</i>, or bushbuck, to our astonishment we
came to some very large bovine tracks, which my guide, a
Gilimiss, at once pronounced to be those of wild buffalo. There
were two old bulls. We followed them in and out among the
glades and thick cover near the margin of the river, and found
the marks where they had lain and rolled in the mud during
the previous night; but it became dark before we could come
up with them. My guide, a Midgán, said that four bull
buffaloes had strayed from the Gálla country a few years before,
and that his father had shot two of them with poisoned arrows,
those which we were hunting being the two survivors; and I
am inclined to think these two were perhaps the only specimens
on the Webbe, for I had always been told that buffalo did not
exist anywhere near Somáliland.</p>

<p>I made a very strong zeríba while we were halted here;
for the Aulihán at Burka told me that the Gállas were constantly
raiding down to the river, and that while on the
southern side we were liable to attack, owing to the strong
antipathy to white men which had sprung up in Gállaland.
We were reminded of the insecurity of the border by passing
the skeletons of two Gállas, who a month before had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
promptly killed by the Aulihán “because they looked like
robbers.” Their unburied bodies had been cleaned by vultures,
and left to lie in the long grass by the side of the path; and
whenever, attended by my two hunters, I went out to shoot on
the burnt ground west of camp, we passed them; and the
grinning skulls made us involuntarily feel along our cartridge
belts to see that they were not empty. This condition of insecurity
is very uncomfortable, and it is also a great nuisance
when one is out shooting, as when hunting <i>dól</i> in the thick
bush one cannot hope for success if attended by more than two
men, because of the difficulty in moving silently; and three
riflemen, miles from camp in thick bush, would make a poor
defence against a strong raiding party of Gállas.</p>

<p>I devoted one day to a buffalo hunt, which was more
exciting than successful. In the early morning we went into
the forest again and came on the fresh tracks of the two buffalo,
in the densest bush near the river bank, the whole jungle being
composed of evergreens and a network of creepers. It was
necessary to stoop and sometimes to crawl on all fours through
the tunnels of vegetation; sometimes five or six creepers clinging
around arms and legs held me fast, so that it would have
been impossible to shoot; I had to go bareheaded because of
the tangled vines which constantly swept off my canvas hat;
but this did not matter, because the density of the forest
afforded protection from the sun’s rays,—indeed there was perpetual
twilight inside. Underfoot were the débris of all kinds
of timber, almost impossible to climb over without making
some noise. The whole jungle smelt of monkeys. They could
be seen overhead covering the branches in clusters, their chattering
giving notice of our approach as we stole along. There
were two kinds: the large dog-faced baboon, different from those
found in the mountains of Somáliland chiefly in the absence
of the full gray mane; and a small tree monkey, whose scientific
name I am ignorant of.</p>

<p>After creeping about noiselessly for the space of two hours
with Géli and Hassan, I put up the buffalo at a distance of about
twenty yards, but we could only hear the heavy pounding of
the earth and cracking of sticks as they galloped off, with continuous
crashing through the undergrowth, and the hollow sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of the larger limbs of the trees breaking as they charged ahead.
We followed, in the course of the morning putting them up no
less than seven times. Once we came to their lair, at a spot
in the densest line of thicket close to the river, where four large
banyan-trees grew together, their roots and descending branches
interlacing to form a labyrinth of caves with upright pillars.
The place was nearly dark; it smelt of buffalo and was full of
their droppings; one of the exits was a tunnel through the
thicket about five feet high. Through this they had escaped,
and finding they could not pass under a branch six inches thick,
which spread horizontally across this opening at a height of
four feet, they had charged it full tilt and broken it short off.
Following the buffalo, we put them up again, but they broke
back towards the eastern part of the jungle, the original end
from which we had first driven them. I had been after them
for three hours, and though we had heard their rush close to us
many times we had never obtained a glimpse of them. They
were dodging about in the thickest parts of the forest and
would not face us among the glades.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Central African Buffalo</span> (<i>Bubalis centralis</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>At last I decided to go to camp and organise a drive. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
assembled all the men, and sending them in at the west end, I
sat with the two hunters on an old platform from which the
boys were accustomed to scare birds from the crops, at the east
end, and waited for the buffalo to be driven past me. The platform
was a flimsy structure some six feet high, and commanded
a good view of the edge of the woods and the reeds bordering
the river, through which I hoped the buffalo would break.</p>

<p>The men from the west end of the jungle were extended
to form a semicircle, and they moved towards me, firing guns
and shouting. The brutes now got into a patch of the thickest
bush, near where we had found their lair in the four trees growing
together, so to get them out of this stronghold my men set
fire to the jungle. Towards evening, when the fire was at its
height, the buffalo at last made up their minds, and instead of
coming into the reeds they broke back through the line of men,
charging into them in spite of a shower of badly-aimed Snider
bullets; and escaping from the forest, they cantered over a mile
of open grass plain to the dense thorn bush and high grass on
the slope leading up towards the Gálla mountains. Of course
by the time I had run through the half mile of covert into the
open they had disappeared. They never returned to Shendil
while we were encamped there, and I have no doubt they left
the country altogether.</p>

<p>At dusk on the evening of the 13th I went out to the burnt
plain and got up to a herd of waterbuck, shooting a cow in
mistake for the bull, and then wounding the bull. He got
away into long grass, and night coming on I lost him.
Going to follow him up next morning I first made for the
body of the cow. I found that a lion had discovered it early
in the night, and, eating his fill, had left the remainder to the
hyænas. Following up the tracks of the lion, I found the
carcase of the wounded bull, which the lion had followed up
and struck down, close to a thicket of thorn bush and high
grass. Part of the haunches was consumed, and the lion had
apparently gone into the patch of grass to sleep or watch over
the meat.</p>

<p>Silently sitting down behind a bush close by with my two
hunters, I waited from eight o’clock till noon for the lion to
come out. Vultures were perched on all the tops of the thorn-trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
and would occasionally swoop to the ground and walk
round at a respectful distance from the meat; but they always
took alarm again and flew back to their perches, no doubt
fearing the lion would come out. Lions often watch meat in
this manner by day. So still did we sit behind our screen
of bushes watching the dead waterbuck that a large spotted
hyæna came up to within two yards of my face without
seeing me! I had to cough, otherwise he would have been
right on to me, and there is no knowing what even a hyæna
would do when so close. He gave one look, and the hair
bristling up along his back he rushed away, coming to a halt
eighty yards off to look back. Then he cantered through the
jungle and I lost sight of him.</p>

<p>Finding the lion did not come out of the grass, we searched
it through and through, and discovered that he must have heard
us coming when we first found the carcase in the morning, and
retired before us. So we gave it up and returned to camp.
We had scarcely left the spot twenty yards behind us on our
way home, when two Adone women, one of them young, plump,
and almost pretty, came up and asked us for meat. We
pointed to the carcase of the waterbuck, which had been
partly eaten by the lion, and although it had lain under a
tropical sun all the morning, they at once set to work to cut
off the meat which was left, to take home for their own
dinner.</p>

<p>The <i>Dair</i>, or rainy season, now coming on, the river began
to rise rapidly. It was long past the time agreed upon for
meeting the Gálla chief Dubbi Harré at Karanleh, and Yahia
now sent me word that the Gállas had looted several animals
from the Karanleh people, and fighting between the Somális and
Gállas had broken out, all communication with Gállaland
being thus interrupted. Finding that I had not enough leave
left to go into Gállaland unless Dubbi Harré came down to
Karanleh to help me, I decided to march as quickly as possible
through Ogádén and the Habr Gerhajis country to the coast,
four hundred miles distant.</p>

<p>On the 15th I went to the burnt plain and shot a very fine
lesser koodoo buck, and in the evening, while marching to
Yahia’s, I bagged two more waterbuck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day we arrived at the ford at Karanleh, called
Maaruf, where we had first crossed the river. The stream was
now in flood, the bollards which we had driven into the mud
had been carried away, and it took all the evening to stretch
the rope across. I had not a fathom of rope to spare, and I
feared that unless we could cross next day we might be kept a
week or two on the southern bank through the further rising
of the river. We, however, crossed with great difficulty on the
following day. During the passage a freshet came down,
drowning one camel and overturning a raft, with a good deal
of valuable kit and a Snider rifle, several documents, amongst
which were several maps, going down in thirty feet of water. The
loss I felt most was that of my botanical collection. Although
my men spent the whole evening diving for the things they
were never recovered. I did not care to halt on the northern
bank and order another day’s diving, because of the danger
from crocodiles. The men had done their best, but in the
strong current the efforts of even my Aden Somális, who are
superb divers, were in vain.</p>

<p>On the following day we journeyed down the river along
the northern or Somáli bank, and made two marches to the
neighbourhood of Sen Morettu, halting just opposite the forest
at Shendil, where I had unsuccessfully hunted buffalo a few
days before. I sent men across on an Adone raft which I had
caused to be towed down from Karanleh, but they returned and
reported that the buffalo had not come back from the hills.
On the short march to Sen Morettu I shot a very fine waterbuck
and a Sœmmering’s gazelle, and the next day I shot a
waterbuck and a lesser koodoo. I was anxious to get a good
specimen of the <i>dól</i>, with a view to having it scientifically
identified, so we had all the pitfalls in the neighbouring forest
repaired by the Adone; but none of the bushbucks fell in
while I was at Sen Morettu.</p>

<p>On the 21st I organised a beat for <i>dól</i>. I saw nothing,
but one of the men in the line of beaters, Hadji Adan, shot a
fine buck with his Snider. He was in company with a
doe, which broke back through the line, hopping over one of
the men, hitting his forehead with her hoofs, and so knocking
him down! She succeeded in making good her escape, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
other men were too astonished to fire. At sunset I shot another
good waterbuck.</p>

<p>I now marched for the coast. The return journey was
over ground most of which I have previously described. We
passed through several Somáli tribes, all of which were of course
friendly. On the way the natives told me that the Abyssinians
had received a great defeat from the Danakil tribes near Obok,
and that my Abyssinian friend Basha-Basha had been killed;
also that war had broken out between the Abyssinians and
the Suákin dervishes. But I was unable to verify either of
these reports.</p>

<p>During three days I made six marches, covering sixty miles,
in a course running almost due north. The only game I saw
on these marches was a wart-hog, which appeared staring me in
the face at a distance of ten feet, as I was moving through long
grass at dawn. The rising sun was shining in his eyes, and I
knocked him over stone dead by a shot in the chest before he
had time to realise the situation. He had a beautiful pair of
tusks, long, thick, and white.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 26th I heard that near a karia
ahead of us a man had been lately attacked by a man-eating
lion and was not expected to live. I made a short march to
the karia and halted for the noon camp close by. At the request
of the relations of the sick man, while camp was being pitched, I
walked over to the karia with my hunters, carrying a bucket full
of carbolic lotion, a quart of carbolic oil, iodoform, lint and bandages,
and a syringe. We came to a hut, outside which was a
crowd of people; and looking in I saw, lying on the bare ground,
the body of a man without any clothing on. He was smeared
over the head and body with dust and blood, and had seven or
eight deep fang wounds in the small of the back and low down
in his left side near the bowel. All these wounds were uncared
for, and on closer inspection I found them to be swarming with
white maggots! I asked permission to have him carried outside
the hut, where it was lighter; but his relations at first objected,
saying in his hearing that he was sure to die, it would
only give him unnecessary pain, and it was the will of Allah
that he should die. The man, however, after some persuasion
consented, and as gently as we could we lifted him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
floor of the hut, where he had been lying for the last thirty
hours, and laid him on a camel-mat outside.</p>

<p>Having obtained permission to try my best with the medicines
I had brought, I first got his wife to wash him all over, the
other relations looking on at every movement of the white man
with great interest; I don’t think they cared much about the
sick man. When he had been washed he looked more cheerful,
and turning him over I made a careful examination of the
wounds. There were eight deep holes in the small of the
back, dangerously near the spine, where the lion had taken him
up and dropped him two or three times; and there were a
couple of wounds deep in the left side, which had not,
fortunately, penetrated the bowel. I told the man that there
was no reason, with luck, why he should not recover, and he
became quite cheerful, and gave me permission to probe the
wounds. His uncle now appeared with a piece of stick having
a shred of tobe twisted round it, and with this rough instrument
we probed all the wounds, and I syringed them out carefully
with carbolic lotion. The bystanders never ceased wondering at
the performance of the glass syringe. The wounded man, like
a true Somáli, never even murmured during this treatment.
At last I was able to let him sit up, clean and almost smiling,
all the holes in his body neatly plugged with pieces of lint
soaked in carbolic oil; I gave his relations medicine for twenty
days’ use, and a new tobe for bandaging, as well as a lecture
on further treatment. They never ceased begging for the
syringe, but I could not spare that, as we were going through
lion country and might want it.</p>

<p>The story of the occurrence, which the natives then told
me, was interesting. This man, with twenty other men and
boys, had been asleep, two nights before, in a camel karia a
few miles away. The camel karias are merely thorn fences
round the camels, and there are no huts, the men sleeping on
the inside of the fence in the open air. At about five in the
morning, just before dawn, a lion sprang into the zeríba and
seized this man, his companions making off, and the camels
stampeding into the darkness. The man’s own account of
what occurred then follows. He struck at the lion frantically
with his hands, and the brute let him go, retiring to a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
distance to watch him. The lion came on again, taking him
up a second time and carrying him a few yards to the edge of
the fence. Again the man struck out at the lion and he let go.
A third time he took him up, and again the man, who was
nearly exhausted, drove him off; and the lion, either frightened
away by the dawn of day or impressed at the spirit shown by
his victim, sneaked off. The man remembered no more till his
friends returned some time afterwards, expecting to find only a
few bones; and they carried him to the home karia and threw
him into a hut to die, the thought of giving him food or
washing the blood and dust from him not occurring to them;
and there he had lain for thirty hours. To this day I have
never heard whether or not he recovered, but having seen
instances of wonderful recoveries among Somális, I am inclined
to think he had a very good chance, that is, provided his
relations used the carbolic lotion and did not steal the white
tobe directly my back was turned.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day I made another short
march, and arrived at a place where a leopard had just killed a
goat while the flocks were returning from pasture to a karia.
We hastily constructed a shelter, and I sat two yards from one
of my own goats, which I had tied up as a bait, with the wind
blowing in my face, and the two hunters at my side with spare
rifles. There was a faint moon, and at about nine o’clock a
leopard charged the goat and killed it. I sat quietly till the
hubbub had subsided, and then, as the leopard lay on the goat
sucking its blood, with its back to me and its tail twitching
close to my feet, I fired for the centre of its back, and it rolled
over stone dead, with its four paws in the air, beside its victim.
We raised a cheer, and all the men coming from camp, we
carried it to the door of my tent and skinned it by the light
of torches.</p>

<p>Next morning, as I had had good sport with the leopard,
before marching I gave the women at the karias a large present
of beads. Directly they knew that I had given the beads to
Adan Yusuf to be distributed, they all rushed at him like
tigresses, and in a fright he dropped the beads and fled. The
women fought and wrangled till we had loaded and marched
away. Several of the old men came to me and said that now I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
had given the beads the women would be quarrelling with each
other for days, and would neglect the cattle, and require to be
well beaten before things settled down again. As we marched
off through the bush I shot a prowling hyæna.</p>

<p>On the 28th, while I was marching ahead of the caravan
with the two hunters, I saw a herd of seven Waller’s gazelles
and began stalking them. While we were still two hundred
yards away, three leopards charged into the middle of the herd
and killed a young doe before our eyes, scattering the others
in every direction. We ran up to where the leopards were
squatting over the carcase, in the middle of a broad open glade,
but while we were still some distance away they saw us and
all three made off at a canter. I think they were ordinary
leopards, and not the long-legged, pale-skinned hunting leopard
(the <i>chítah</i> of India). I fired at one of them and missed,
and then we sat by the side of the dead Walleri till the
caravan came up, hoping to see the brutes, but they never
returned.</p>

<p>The following day we arrived at a deep well called Garbo.
As we approached this well we saw vultures swooping towards
two or three dead trees which overtopped the jungle, and
searching about we found the bodies of a leopard and seven
spotted hyænas, which had been poisoned during the night by
a Midgán. He had drawn up water from the deep well and
exposed it for the night in a shallow wooden bowl,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> mixed with
poison which he had concocted from various herbs. The
success of his manœuvre was evident. The leopard had been
half eaten by the hyænas, but I preserved the skull.</p>

<p>The natives whom we found encamped near here were very
suspicious and surly, as they had had some disagreement with
Prince Ruspoli’s caravan which had passed through before me.
As we marched in the afternoon I left Hadji Adan with four men,
and three camels loaded with water-casks, to follow us with a
good supply of water. We had only gone a mile when we
heard several shots fired in quick succession, and all running
back to the wells, we found my men in sole possession. The
natives had refused to allow them to take any water, and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
men, instead of returning and complaining to me as they should
have done, thinking to have a bit of fun, had fired a few shots
over the heads of the crowd, sending them flying, with a worse
impression of European caravans than they had before. I was
naturally very angry and disgusted with Hadji Adan, who
looked sheepish when I told him, in choice language, what I
thought of him. On this march I fired three shots with my
Lee-Metford rifle at a beautiful oryx bull which was galloping
away. When he was already three hundred yards distant my
third shot brought him down, and we camped by the body to
take full advantage of the supply of meat.</p>

<p>Next day we made two hard marches to Daba-Jérissa,
where I remained on 1st October, shooting a fine lesser koodoo
buck. The people at Daba-Jérissa asked me to give judgment,
in my capacity of Englishman, as to the amount of blood-money
to be paid by another tribe for the murder of one of
their number; but I said I would only arbitrate if both parties
would appeal to me as a disinterested stranger, and that I
could not undertake to act for the British Government,
especially so far from Berbera.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>On 2nd October we made two long marches to the wells at
Sassamani, where guinea-fowl swarmed in tens of thousands,
blackening the river-bed as they came to drink in the evenings;
and I had good sport here with the gun. On the way
I attacked a herd of Sœmmering’s gazelles with the Lee-Metford,
and dropped four bucks with six shots, at ranges
between two hundred and fifty and three hundred yards.
I gave most of the meat to some people whom we found at
the wells, instead of a present of cloth which they asked me for.</p>

<p>On 5th October we arrived at the Gagáb wells at Milmil.
Here I arranged a division of the caravan into two parts, sending
one portion to Berbera by the shortest route, so that the
men might be paid off and the camels sold; and I kept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
other portion to accompany me in a leisurely journey to the
coast by way of the Eidegalla Haud, where I hoped to get
some lions. We left Milmil on the 6th of October and marched
to a Rer Ali karia, and on the following day we made two
marches to a large water-pan at Awáré. As no rain had fallen
for months in this locality till quite recently, the pan was dry,
but a deep well sunk through its bed contained plenty of water.
The pan at Awáré is an isolated depression far out on the
Haud Plateau, which contains rain-water for several weeks at
a time. It is three marches to the north of Milmil, the last
Ogádén watering-place on the southern edge of the Haud;
and when the pan, or the well which the natives sink through
its bed, contains water, the flocks and camels of the Rer Ali
and Rer Harún are brought to Awáré to take advantage of
the rich Haud pastures, which have better fattening qualities
than those of Milmil. While passing through the Rer Ali
grazing camels, of which there were many hundreds, on our
way to the pan, we were all much amused by watching my
hunter Geli, who was walking in front with my spare rifle over
his shoulder. Before he joined me he had often, with the rest
of his tribe, who were the Eidegalla, made looting excursions
on horseback to this part of the Haud. As he walked on, looking
at the fat humps of the camels to right and left, he wore an
angelic smile on his face, and sang softly, “<i>Hilib badan ai-y-ee
ee</i>” (Lots of meat, plenty of meat!) When he turned round
and saw the whole caravan laughing at him he stopped and
looked sheepish.</p>

<p>Geli was a capital fellow, and my men used to tell a story
about him which he never contradicted. It appears that when
only sixteen years old he was out looking after goats with his
mother and sisters. A lion bolted off with one of the flock,
and Geli, with the women, began idly to track him up, to see
if he had gone far; because, if the lion was not far off, it might
be worth while to call up the men from the karia to follow him.
Geli went on ahead, and found the lion asleep under a bush,
having eaten the goat. Geli decided to go and tell the tribe,
but as he was turning away he thought he would just throw
his spear, it looked so easy! He aimed at the lion’s ribs,
hurled his spear, and then ran for his karia as hard as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
could go; and coming back to look with twenty men on horseback,
he found the lion dead.</p>

<p>The Haud in this locality is one mass of unbroken thorn
forest, sometimes light and open, sometimes very dense, with
high <i>durr</i> grass. Round the Awáré pan the forest is composed
of very fine <i>gudá</i> thorn-trees, which grow for about fifteen feet
without branches, and then shoot up and outwards in a fan-shape
to a height of from thirty to forty feet The bark is
black, and the foliage is made up of small star-shaped leaves,
massed together and very green. It is the most picturesque
tree in the Haud forest, and nothing can be prettier than the
Awáré pan when the margin of open, flat meadow-land is
covered with a carpet of fresh turf, and the trees are in foliage.
On arriving at Awáré we pitched camp under a large <i>gudá</i>
tree at the north-west corner of the pan, and I made my bed
on the flat top of another on the eastern side, and tied up a
donkey below. Lions roared in the forest a mile or two away,
but did not come near the camp.</p>

<p>Next morning, without waiting for coffee, I got down from
the tree and made straight for where we had heard the lions.
About three miles from our tree we came on the fresh tracks
of a large lion and lioness, and followed them. The bush was
rather open, and the lioness must have been doing sentry and
have seen us,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> for we could hear her roaring in the jungle some
distance ahead of us as she roused her mate; and running on in
the direction of the noise, we were just in time to see a very
large black-maned lion bound out of a thicket and make off,
followed by a lioness. The grass was rather long, only showing
their heads, and owing to intervening thorn-trees and the
distance, I could not get a chance to shoot. We tracked these
lions until a heavy shower of rain came on and lost us the
tracks in the afternoon. I was hungry and suffering from a
galled foot, and we were twice drenched with rain before we
got home.</p>

<p>I lay at night on the top of the <i>gudá</i> tree near camp, but
did not get a shot. A lion roared several times, early in the
night, in the distance, but a shower of rain coming on before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
dawn, the people whom I sent out from camp failed to find his
tracks.</p>

<p>On the 9th we moved the camp to a karia a few miles to
the north-west, where lions were reported to be common. I sat
all night in the top of a tree over a heifer tethered below, to no
purpose. Next morning we came upon tracks of two lionesses
and three cubs; but we only found them at 8 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>, and the
enormous flocks and herds of the Rer Ali had wandered about
the jungle in every direction, and almost entirely obliterated the
signs, so we gave it up; and we moved camp back to the former
site at the Awáré pan. In the evening news of lions came from
two opposite directions, south-west and north-east. I sent
several horsemen out to verify the first, and I sent Hassan five
miles to the south-east to the carcase of a camel which had been
struck down by the lions, and ordered him to sit in a tree all
night, and keep hyænas from the carcase by throwing stones at
it. He had seen a lioness bound away as he came up to the
spot at sunset, and sitting in a <i>galól</i> tree waiting for the brute’s
return, he spent a most miserable night, for it rained heavily,
and became so dark that a mob of hyænas dragged away the
meat in spite of his stoning. In the morning, because of this
rain, Hassan failed to find any tracks; so he returned to my
camp, aching all over, for a rotten and twisted <i>galól</i> tree covered
with large black ants is not a comfortable perch on a cold night.
The horsemen whom I sent to the south-west reported the lion
news to be a hoax of the karia people there, concocted in the
hope of obtaining <i>bakshísh</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> During the day I received a visit
from some Rer Ali headmen and minstrels, who serenaded me
on foot while I was trying to get a little sleep at noon.</p>

<p>On the 12th I sent out horsemen to collect news of lions
from the karias, and to make wide circles in the jungle in quest
of tracks; they found those of a family of lionesses and part-grown
lions, there being seven in all; so at night we tied up
a donkey three miles from camp. I was prevented from sitting
up over the bait by very heavy rain coming on towards evening,
so I remained in camp. Next morning we found the donkey
killed by lions and eaten. Coming up in the half light of early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
dawn, and stooping under the bushes, I saw several hyænas, and
among them a lioness, stealing away. The range was nearly
two hundred yards, but I fired and missed. I followed at best
pace, and after twenty minutes’ tracking I saw her head for a
moment looking over a tuft of grass, as she crouched thirty
yards away, but she bounded off before I had time to look over
the sight. I fired a shot after her into the grass, which must
have missed. We again tied up a donkey in the same place,
and sat up over it. But at about ten o’clock the dry <i>galól</i>, upon
the flat top of which we had placed my bed, gave way, breaking
off at the fork of the stem, and dropping us, with guns, water-bottles,
and lantern, a distance of twelve feet, to the ground!
It was very dark and a heavy thunder-storm was coming up, so
we lit the lantern and trudged home through the bush. We
left the donkey tied up, and coming next morning to take him
away, we found he had been untouched by lions, and several
cowardly hyænas had prowled round him all night afraid to
tackle him; so that, except in his feelings, he was unhurt.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th, having heard a lion roar not
far from camp at midnight, I sent out horsemen, and at 9 <span class="smcapuc">A.M.</span>
they reported tracks of two lionesses. Almost simultaneously
came news that a goat had been killed by a lion at a karia about
five miles away. The men said it must have been a large lion
by the tracks and by the sound of his roar as he had bounded
away, quite unlike the voice of a lioness. So I walked there
with my two hunters, arriving soon after ten o’clock, and taking
the owner of the goat as my guide, I made straight for the
karia where the kill had occurred. The two horsemen who
had brought the news followed me, leading their horses, in red
and blue <i>khaili</i> tobes; but I dropped these men at the karia as
being too conspicuous and likely to attract the lion’s attention.</p>

<p>We then followed the pugs of the lion from the zeríba, the
parallel lines in the red soil showing where he had dragged
his victim along. The trail was difficult to follow, as the ground
had been overrun by sheep during the morning. At last we
came to a very small boy in charge of a flock of sheep, and
he told us there were no more domestic animals farther on,
and that the lion had gone into a dark jungle of <i>khansa</i> and
<i>durr</i> grass. We entered the jungle, and as we rounded a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
<i>khansa</i> thicket my hunter Liban said, “There he is!” and I saw
his great shock head and shoulders come from out of a black
overhanging <i>khansa</i> bush twenty-five yards away, which had
been his lair, and in which we subsequently found the body of
the goat. I had only time to see his huge head and mane
come indistinctly through the foliage, when he bounded away
to my left, across a space of two yards of open, into a patch of
<i>durr</i> grass six feet high. I followed him with the sight of the
rifle on his shoulder as he disappeared, and the trigger being
rather heavy I did not actually get it off till he was well inside
the grass. The rifle went off, and a loud roar followed as he
galloped on, showing that he had been hit. The roar died
away at once into a suppressed growl, then all was silence.</p>

<p>Now came the work of following him up. Making a circuit
to the right we examined the expanse of grass and jungle
into which he had sprung; it was very thick and extensive,
stretching to the right and left for several hundred yards, so
there was nothing for it but to follow him through it. We first
fired a Snider at the place where we had last heard him, at
the same time throwing sticks and shouting; and then, foot by
foot, we took up his path, which was bathed in blood, straight
through the high grass. From the very hurried nature of my
shot I did not hope to have disabled him, although the rifle
I had been shooting with was a heavy eight-bore Paradox.
After going another half dozen yards, as we came to a mimósa,
Liban said, “He is lying dead beyond that <i>khansa</i> bush.”
Peeping through and seeing a mass of yellow, I saw that Liban
was right. Skirting round, we found a noble, yellow-maned
lion, the finest I had seen, in perfect condition and in the prime
of life. My natives called my attention to the peculiar position
in which he was lying, under the farther side of the mimósa.
He had bounded away from his lair, getting my eight-bore
bullet obliquely in behind the left lung, and out at the point
of the right shoulder. He had roared and bounded on with
this wound, and after going fifteen yards had taken the mimósa
in one spring, falling dead in his tracks. We measured the
bush over which he had sprung, and found it was eighteen feet
broad and eight feet high, and absence of marks on the surrounding
sand showed that he could not possibly have gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
round. My theory is that the wound took full effect just as he
made this supreme effort, landing him practically lifeless. The
skin, when taken off, measured 10 feet 11 inches from nose to
tip of tail when spread without stretching or pegging out. As I
knelt looking at his head, surrounded by the men, women, and
children who had flocked from the karias, I only wished for an
European companion to help me admire him!</p>

<p>In the evening I made another platform in a <i>gudá</i> tree
three miles to the south of camp. From my tent to about a
mile south of it there was gravel. I found that lions, in passing
camp to go to prospect some karias to the south-west of us,
avoided the gravel, no doubt because it was uncomfortable for
their feet, and invariably walked over the fine red clay a little
farther to the south. Hence the choice of my new hiding-place.
I spread my bed on the flat top of the tree, fourteen feet
from the ground. It was like a spring mattress, gently
waving before a cool breeze; and we slept beautifully most
of the night, hung up in the air, with a brilliant canopy of
stars above us and the mysterious sea of bush around us, with
lions roaring frequently during the night. Next morning I was
taken off on a “wild-goose chase” to a karia six miles distant
to the north, where a lioness had taken a small goat in sight
of the karia people; but the sheep and camels had since been
driven over the tracks and we lost her, having to abandon, besides,
the search for the tracks of the lion which had roared near
my machán the night before.</p>

<p>I remained in camp on the 15th to let the skin of the large
lion dry, and again slept in the machán three miles to the south
of camp. The lions roared again; for there were a pair of them,
the voice of the lioness being easily distinguishable from that
of her mate. They never came to the donkey, and a heavy
thunder-storm drenching us and our bedding, we lit a lantern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and threaded our way to camp, leading the donkey, through
the darkness. Sending out horsemen next morning, the tracks
of the pair could not be found anywhere, so it was decided that
their roars must either have been uttered from an immense distance,
or that they must have been devils! But I think that,
owing to the wet weather, their voices appeared to be very
much nearer than they really were.</p>

<p>My leave now being at an end, we marched for Adadleh,
over a waterless tract of Haud ninety miles in extent. We
covered this distance in nine marches, or four and a half days,
the whole of the country passed over having been one continuous
sea of dense bush, dotted over with red ant-hills, some of
the spires being twenty-five feet high. We arrived at Berbera
on the 31st of October 1893, and I crossed to Aden next day
on the way to England.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTES ON THE WILD
FAUNA OF SOMÁLILAND</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lion</span> (<i>Felis leo</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Libah</i></p>

<p>Lion-shooting involves long
halts of several days among the
Somáli karias, with crowds of
natives continually standing
round camp, the dust from
the countless camels and sheep
filling the air and covering the bushes. Under these circumstances
it may well be understood that other game is scarce, and
that sitting unoccupied in camp waiting for news of a lion is
not always interesting. Frequently the news which is brought
in of lions having visited karias two or three miles away, taking
a sheep or a heifer, or a young camel, as the case may be, is very
unreliable. Yet the hunter must be ready to start on the
instant, and after a tramp lasting from five to ten hours, he will
return as often as not to his tent tired out, the victim of a silly
hoax concocted for the purpose of wheedling <i>bakshísh</i> out of him.</p>

<p>Every few days one of these trips will probably end in a
real find, and then grand excitement will be felt in creeping
among the tunnels made by the dark <i>khansa</i> bushes, looking for
the crouching enemy, which may spring up from any distance
and from any direction; and there is an additional danger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
three or four men being huddled together with rifles on full
cock in such jungle.</p>

<p>As I have been nearly always travelling incessantly and
generally on duty, I have seldom had time to wait among the
Somáli karias for news of lions, and when I have been on leave,
and time has permitted, I have generally preferred to camp
among the mountains and look for large koodoo, amid fine
scenery and away from the noise and dust of inhabited country.
This, to my mind, is by far the most fascinating sport to be had
in Somáliland. I have, however, had many shots at lions when
marching, and have brought home the trophies of four. To
make a good bag of lions, it is necessary to devote a trip exclusively
to lion-shooting, but to my mind the bright moments
of intense excitement do not come often enough to compensate
for the long monotonous days in camp.</p>

<p>Lions are still numerous in Somáliland, chiefly in unexplored
parts of the Haud and Ogádén. It is probable that many of
the Haud lions never drink except when they can find pools of
rain-water. They may be encountered at all times of the year
at distances up to fifty miles or more from the nearest water.
The Midgáns go after them a good deal, and bring their skins
to Berbera and Aden for sale, but they are seldom good skins,
very often being riddled with spear holes inflicted wantonly
after death. When a lion has committed so many depredations
among the karias that the men living in them are roused to the
point of banding together to kill him, Somális and Midgáns,
according to their own account, go after him on horseback till
they bring him to a standstill in the open. Then they bait him
by galloping round at full speed and shouting. The lion turns
this way and that, trying to face them as they whirl round; and
getting confused with the shouting and dust, he falls a prey to
the arrows of the Midgáns, who mount and ride away to a safe
distance with the other Somális, and wait for his death. Sometimes
one of the horsemen is knocked over: an angry lion, unless
too done up to make good his charge, being easily able to catch
a bad or a tired pony.</p>

<p>The movements of the native encampments seem chiefly to
influence the changes of quarters of the lions, the latter following
the karias as they move to fresh pastures. When a family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
with its flocks and herds and its karias, moves, its attendant
lions, if there should be any, accompany it, being sometimes
man-eaters and more often cattle-eaters. Last June my own
caravan, while returning to the coast from Ogádén, was followed
during two days, over a distance of forty miles, by a pair of
hungry lions. We discovered this by chance, when some scouts
of mine happened to go back along the road.</p>

<p>A few years ago there used to be plenty of lions in Guban,
in the reeds bordering the Issutugan river, and about Kabri-Bahr,
and along the foot of Gólis Range. Now the best country for
them is decidedly the Haud Plateau and Ogádén, where there
are still a good many. Milmil is sometimes a good place; also
the base of Bur Dab Mountain, and the Waredad Plain, where
there are patches of <i>durr</i> grass an acre or two in extent, with
a few shady thorn-trees growing within them. They make
their lair in the high grass under the shade of a tree, and as
the grass patches are surrounded by bare red soil or sand, the
pugs are easily found, and the brutes can be driven out into
the open and shot. Lions living in the Haud, where it is
elevated five thousand to six thousand feet, have better coats and
manes than those found in Guban or in Ogádén, and the best
skins I have seen have come from the elevated <i>ban</i> or open prairie.
All the animals of the elevated country have thicker coats than
those of the corresponding varieties found in the low country,
this being necessary, no doubt, as a protection against the cold.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Elephant</span> (<i>Elephas africanus</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Maródi</i></p>

<p>The Somáli elephant has within the last five years been
much persecuted by sportsmen, and I am afraid that if this
destruction goes on, in the near future there will be none left
in Northern Somáliland, for they have entirely left their old
haunts. In 1884, when Egypt evacuated Somáliland, elephants
were plentiful on Wagar and Gólis, coming down to the southern
edge of the Maritime mountains. Driven in December by the
cold from the high interior, they wandered down the sand-rivers,
feeding on the <i>armo</i> creepers and aloes.</p>

<p>Since Sir Richard Burton’s expedition thirty-nine years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
ago, few, if any, Europeans entered Somáliland until 1884,
when two officers from Aden visited Gólis in search of elephants
almost simultaneously with Mr. F. L. James’s expedition to the
Webbe. From this time the disappearance of the elephant has
been very rapid, and nearly all the herds have retired to the
mountainous country in which the Tug Fáfan takes its rise; but
a few herds still come down annually into the Gadabursi country.
In 1884 elephants were shot at Dalaat and Digwein, places
near Mandeira in the interior plain north of Gólis; and since that
year I have never heard of them anywhere in this plain. In
1887 I had to ascend to Wagar before finding any, and since
then they have retired from Wagar and Gólis altogether, and
are never now by any chance, I believe, found east of Hargeisa, unless
we except herds which wander eastward into the far interior
of Ogádén from the western valleys of the Harar Highlands.</p>

<p>The cause of elephants having been driven away to such an
extent is that sportsmen have not been satisfied with the death
of a bull or two here and there, but have slaughtered large
numbers of cows. In the first enthusiasm of elephant-shooting
it is conceivable that a sportsman may shoot two or three cows
as well as bulls, as I have done; but there is no reason, except
the temptation afforded by very exciting sport, why large
numbers of elephants of both sexes should be destroyed in
Somáliland. They do no harm to the few plots of cultivation
scattered at wide intervals, and very few Somális will eat their
flesh. Though the elephants themselves are of the average size,
this mountain ivory is probably as small as any to be found in
Africa, sixty pounds being a very good pair of tusks, though
greater weights have of course been recorded in exceptional cases.</p>

<p>I believe the question of the desirability of training and
using the African elephants for transport is one which will
become more important every year as Africa is opened up.
Provided something could be done to stop the wholesale
slaughter of elephants by English sportsmen, there is still a
probability that the whole of our Somáli Protectorate would
become restocked, for in the chaos of rugged gorges which
descend abruptly from the Harar Highlands into Ogádén there
are still plenty. I do not think that a moderate amount of
elephant-shooting, properly regulated, does much harm, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
herds are certain to leave places where they have been hunted
about without respite season after season, and where large
numbers have been slaughtered.</p>

<p>In the Gólis Range there are many of the old elephant paths
still existing, but the bones are very seldom found; and the
Somális have a theory to account for this. In 1886 I went to
Digwein, where an officer had shot a large bull elephant two
years before, and I was shown the exact spot where it had been
killed; and rummaging among the bushes we found the jaw-bones,
with the heavy grinders still embedded in them. The
Somális said this was all that was left of it, because the Esa
Músa cattle and the koodoo antelopes had eaten all the soft
parts of the bones.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Black Rhinoceros</span> (<i>Rhinoceros bicornis</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Wiyil</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 460px;" id="illus39">
<img src="images/illus39.jpg" width="460" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Somáli Rhinoceros</span> (<i>Rhinoceros bicornis</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>For many years the black rhinoceros has been known to
exist in the interior of Somáliland; and going farther in every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
year, I have constantly been expecting to come into its
ground.</p>

<p>The first Somáli rhinoceroses were shot by my brother and
myself in our Abyssinian border trip in August 1892, and
since then only a few have been bagged by Europeans. They
come far north of the range of the zebras, sometimes wandering
as far towards the coast as the open grass plains of Toyo,
a hundred miles south of Berbera, where they hide in the
patches of <i>durr</i> grass. They are common in the southern parts
of the Haud; I never found any signs of them during many
expeditions in the Habr Awal, Esa, and Gadabursi countries.
They are most common in the valleys of the Tug Jerer and
Tug Fáfan, and thence southward as far as the Webbe; and
they are also plentiful beyond the Webbe in Gállaland. Rhinoceroses
are said to exist to the south-east of Berbera, but in our
trip to the Dolbahanta country we never saw any traces of them.</p>

<p>We found these to be the most stupid game animals we
have encountered, and easily approached if the wind was right.
They were not very prone to charge, and in their blind, headlong
rush seemed to see nothing, so that by stepping to one
side and standing perfectly still a man would probably be safe.
The transparent and thorny nature of the <i>billeil</i> bush, which
is always their last sanctuary, renders a man rather helpless,
and if seen and charged, and unable to find elbow-room owing
to the walls of impenetrable thorns, he would probably be killed.
Rhinoceros-shooting is very exciting, but it is chiefly the fearful
nature of the jungle which makes it so. I have never seen
more than three of these brutes together. The ground they
usually prefer is a network of very stony, broken hills, covered
with <i>galól</i> or <i>billeil</i> jungle, and having some river-bed not too
many miles distant, where they can go at night to drink and
bathe. They travel considerable distances to the river, and
wander all night up and down the channel looking for a convenient
pool, and making a maze of tracks in the soft sand.
The Abbasgúl, Malingúr, and Rer Amáden tribes eat their flesh
when hungry, and I found it very good, and once lived for a
week on very little else.</p>

<p>We could usually cut from fifteen to thirty fighting shields
from each rhinoceros, three-quarters of an inch thick and from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
fifteen to eighteen inches in diameter, worth about a dollar
apiece at the coast. Everywhere in Central Ogádén the
caravan tracks are furrowed in grooves a yard or more long
and six inches deep, which look like the work of a plough.
This is done by the rhinoceros as he walks along.</p>

<p>A good pair of bull’s horns measures nineteen inches for the
front and five inches for the back one.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Antelopes<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>—The Oryx</span> (<i>Oryx beisa</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Beit</i></p>

<p>The oryx is a very stoutly-built, bovine antelope, standing
as high as a donkey, and inhabits open, stony ground, or barren
hills, or open grass plains. It is fairly common and very widely
distributed over the Somáli
country, and it may be found in
all kinds of country except the
thick jungle with aloe undergrowth
which is so much liked
by the lesser koodoo, and the
cedar forests on the higher ranges.
The best oryx ground is in the
Haud and in Ogádén.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;" id="illus40">
<img src="images/illus40.jpg" width="250" height="275" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Oryx</span> (<i>Oryx beisa</i>).</p>
<p class="caption">Length of horns, 34½ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>The oryx feeds chiefly on
grass, and is often found very far
from water. It has keen sight, and
probably protects itself more by
this than by its sense of hearing
or scent. Oryx are found in
herds of from half a dozen to
thirty or forty, chiefly composed
of cows. The only antelopes
which go in very large herds in Northern Somáliland are the
hartebeest and Sœmmering’s gazelle. Bull oryx are found
wandering singly all over the country, and possibly these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
make up in number for the preponderance of cows in the
herds.</p>

<p>Sometimes two or three cows with growing calves will be
found together, making up a small herd of half a dozen. It is
nearly impossible to distinguish which are the bulls in a herd,
and they are so few in proportion to the cows that it is best, if
shooting for sport alone, not to fire at herd animals at all. The
bull is slightly thicker in the neck and higher in the withers
than the cow; and the horns, though an inch or two shorter in
the bull, are more massive, especially about the base, and more
symmetrical, whilst the cow’s horns are frequently bent and of
unequal length. The oryx is often revengeful when wounded
and brought to bay; twice I have seen a wounded one make a
determined charge into a mob of Somális armed with spears.</p>

<p>The Midgáns, who are armed with bows and poisoned
arrows, hunt the oryx with packs of savage yellow pariah dogs;
the thick skin round the withers of a bull is made by them into
a white <i>gáshan</i> or fighting shield. The method of hunting,
as carried out by the Midgáns in the Bulhár Plain, is as follows:
Three or four of them, with about fifteen dogs, go out just before
dawn, and walk along silently through the scattered thorn-trees
till fresh tracks are found, and these are followed till the
game is sighted. By throwing stones, whistling, and other signs
which the dogs understand, they are shown the herd, and settle
down to their work. The dogs run mute, the men following
at a crouching trot, which in a Somáli is untiring; and this
lasts until the dogs open in chorus, having brought the game
to bay. The oryx make repeated charges at the dogs, which
they often wound or kill. If the latter can avoid the sharp
horns of the mother, they fasten on to a calf, and sometimes
the whole herd will charge to the rescue. The Midgáns run
up silently under cover of the bushes and let off a flight of
poisoned arrows into the herd, which, seeing the human enemy,
takes to flight. Frequently an animal wounded by a poisoned
arrow takes a line of its own, and is in due time carefully
followed up and found dead, or it may be pulled down in its
weak state by the dogs.</p>

<p>It was many years ago, while wandering with my hunter,
Ali Hirsi, in the Bulhár Plain, that I first saw the trophies of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
bull oryx, and at once resolved that I would hunt nothing else
till I had brought down a specimen of this beautiful antelope.
As we were walking through a thick part of the bush we
suddenly came upon a group of four Midgáns engaged in lighting
a fire under a large <i>gudá</i> thorn-tree. Resting against
the trunk was the head of a freshly-killed oryx bull, with a
grand pair of horns, starting in continuation with the forehead
and sweeping back in a slight curve to a length of thirty-four
inches. On the branches strips of oryx meat were hanging,
and on the ground lay the rest of the carcase and the skin,
which a man was cleaning with a knife, where it lay in a pool
of frothy blood. Round the tree nine pariah dogs lay about;
they were gnawing offal, and got up lazily, as I approached, to
show their teeth and growl at me, till kicked into silence by
one of the Midgáns. The group was a very striking one, and
although I have since, while feeding my followers in the interior,
shot large numbers of oryx, none have appeared to me so fine
as this first one which I had not the good fortune to shoot.
I haggled with the Midgáns for the head and got it for two
dollars, and also engaged them with their dogs to come hunting
with me on the first day on which I should be able to get away
from Bulhár.</p>

<p>At midnight, a week later, I rode out on a camel, accompanied
by Ali Hirsi, the four Midgáns, and nine dogs. We
slept for a few hours at a Midgán karia out on the plain, and
at dawn struck due south into the heart of the bush. As it
became hot, after having seen nothing but Walleri and small
gazelles all the morning, we sat down to rest, sending a boy,
one of the Midgáns, up a thorn-tree to watch. The dogs lay
round us panting, with their tongues hanging out, and all the
men were soon asleep under the shade, except my Midgán
sentry, who was softly intoning his Mahomedan prayers as he
sat perched on the tree. Suddenly he stopped them with a
jerk, slipped down the trunk of the tree, and came running to
me snapping his fingers. We all got up, and the Midgáns, by
whistling and throwing pebbles, put the dogs on to the broad
path of a large herd of oryx. Off we went, and after running
for five minutes as fast as our legs could carry us, the dogs
being well out of sight, we heard a clamour in the distance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
and crouching low as we ran, came into a glade where we
found the herd bunched together round a thicket, keeping the
dogs back, the oryx charging repeatedly and the dogs dodging
nimbly, trying to cut out the young calves. Directly the oryx
caught sight of us they scattered like a bursting shell. I ran
hard to cut off some of them, jumping over low mimósas and
stepping on large thorns, and the Midgáns sent a flight of
poisoned arrows whizzing past me at the flying herd. The
Midgáns, I knew, wanted meat, so I dropped a large cow with
the .500 Express as she galloped past at forty yards, rolling
her over in her tracks. The Midgáns rushing up, breathed a
short prayer, slashed her throat open, and then stood clear from
the quivering body, while all the dogs fastened on to a calf,
which was soon lying beside the cow with its head cut off;
and after half an hour spent in lighting a fire and roasting some
oryx meat, we loaded up the rest and made for Bulhár.</p>

<p>I have had several trips with these Bulhár Midgáns in
search of oryx. Their camping arrangements are very primitive,
and many a time have I helped them to light a fire by
rubbing two sticks together. Special wood had to be chosen, and
it generally took us from ten to twenty minutes to get a light.</p>

<p>The skin on the withers of a bull oryx is much thicker than
the rest of the skin, being about three-quarters of an inch thick.
The average length of horns in a good bull is thirty-two inches,
in a cow thirty-four inches. Young oryx, when caught and
confined in an enclosure, will sometimes show their stubborn,
wild nature by charging the bars, head down, and so killing
themselves; a case of this kind once occurred in Berbera. The
flesh of a calf oryx is, in my opinion, more delicious than that
of any other antelope, and lions are particularly fond of it.
These calves, when young, are very like those of English cattle
in appearance, but smaller, with stumpy, straight horns a few
inches long. They give out a peculiar half-bleat, half-bellow,
when attacked by dogs or wounded. We fell in with young
calves about the middle of August in two successive years.
Oryx sometimes strike sideways with their horns as we use
a stick. When very angry they lower them till nearly
parallel with the ground, and make a dash forward for a few
yards with surprising swiftness. Oryx are often seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
company with hartebeests and Plateau gazelles. Once I saw
a small herd with some of these latter, and with the mixed herd
were two ostriches.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Koodoo</span> (<i>Strepsiceros Koodoo</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Gódir</i> or <i>Goriáleh Gódir</i> (male); <i>Adér-yu</i> (female); <i>Adér-yu</i> (collective
name for herd animals of both sexes and all ages)</p>

<p>Koodoos are found in mountainous or very broken ground
where there is plenty of bush and good grass and water. The
best koodoo grounds in Somáliland are Gólis Range and the
Gadabursi Hills. The large koodoos scarcely exist in the
parts of Ogádén which I have visited. Either they never
existed there, or, as my followers declared, they died of the
great epidemic of cattle disease four or five years ago. Ogádén
Somális constantly offer to show koodoo to a sportsman, but
they appear to mean the lesser koodoo; and this they call
<i>Gódir</i>, knowing apparently of only the one kind. The Ishák
tribes, on the other hand, have names for both.</p>

<p>Sometimes a solitary old bull will make his midday lair
close to water, in some quiet part of the hills. They are very
retiring, and live in small families, two bulls and seven cows
being the largest number I have noticed together. They prefer
the steepest mountains, but wander about at night in search
of grass in broken ground in the neighbouring plains. An old
male with a heavy pair of horns seems to avoid thick jungle,
where they may catch in the branches, and likes to spend the
heat of the day under the shadow of some great rock on the
mountain side, where he can get a good view around. His eyes,
nose, and ears appear to be equally on the alert, and he is often
very cunning. Although such a heavy animal, he is a good
climber and is hard to stalk, but, once successfully approached,
the steep nature of the ground generally yields him up an easy
victim to the rifle. The alarm-note of the female koodoo is a
loud, startling bark, which echoes far into the surrounding hills,
and is similar to that of the Indian sambar hind.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The bark
is accompanied by an impatient pawing of the ground with
the hoofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The habits of the greater and lesser koodoo exactly correspond
respectively to those of the sambar and spotted deer of
Southern India. Great koodoos live in the mountains, and lesser
koodoos on the bush-covered slopes at their base. Koodoos
are generally timid, but care must be taken when coming
suddenly on them, as I once saw an unwounded bull make
a very determined charge from some thirty yards’ distance
at a solitary man who had been sent to stop the mouth
of a gorge. The man jumped to one side and threw his
spear, grazing the flank of the beast, which then galloped out
into the plain below and escaped. I had a good view of this,
and there could be no doubt as to the intention of the beast.</p>

<p>The koodoo is the largest of all the Somáli antelopes, a
large bull standing about 13 hands 1 inch, and although an
active climber, he is not fast on level ground. A fairly good
pair of horns in Somáliland will measure 3 feet from base to
tip, and 50 inches round the spiral of each horn. The largest
I have ever seen measured 56 inches round the spiral. The
koodoo is rare except in the mountains, and is found on the
highest ground of Northern Somáliland, inhabiting the top
of Wagar Mountain and Gólis Range, which rise to about
six thousand eight hundred feet. It has lately become scarce
even in these parts. The head is a great prize, and a good
pair of horns should be ample reward for a fortnight’s climbing
in the hills.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Lesser Koodoo</span> (<i>Strepsiceros imberbis</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Gódir</i> or <i>Arreh Gódir</i> (male); <i>Adér-yu</i> (female); <i>Adér-yu</i> (collective)</p>

<p>This is, to my mind, quite the most beautiful of all the
Somáli antelopes, and the skin is more brilliantly marked and
the body more gracefully shaped than that of the greater
koodoo. The lesser koodoo is rather smaller than the oryx.</p>

<p>The lesser koodoo is found in thick jungles of the larger
kind of thorn-tree, especially where there is an undergrowth of
the <i>hig</i> or slender pointed aloe, which is of a light green colour,
and grows from four to six feet high. This antelope may also be
found hiding in dense thickets of tamarisk in the river-beds.
It is not found in the open grass plains, and I have never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
seen one in the cedar forests on the top of Gólis. Its
favourite haunt used to be along the foot of this range, and I
do not think its numbers have been much diminished of late
years. By far the best lesser koodoo ground I have ever
visited is the thick forest on the Webbe banks, near Imé and
Karanleh. These Webbe specimens are
different to the ones found under Gólis,
as they are smaller, have shorter horns,
are still more brilliantly marked, and
have hoofs nearly twice as long. The
hoofs of a Webbe lesser koodoo are, like
those of a Webbe bushbuck, of extraordinary
length.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Lesser Koodoo</span></p>
<p class="caption">Length of horns straight, 27½ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>The lesser koodoo likes to be near
water, and living as it does among the
densest thickets, its ears are wonderfully
well developed. It has powerful hind-quarters,
and is a strong leaper, the white
bushy tail flashing over the aloe clumps
as it takes them in great bounds. They
are very cunning, and will stand quite
still on the farther side of a thicket
listening to the advancing trackers, then
a slight rustle is heard as they gallop away. The best way
to get a specimen is to follow the fresh tracks of a buck,
the sportsman advancing in a direction parallel with that
of the tracker, but some fifty yards to one flank and in
advance; a snap shot may then be got as the koodoo bounds
out of the farther side of a thicket, but you may be months
in the country before getting a really good buck. They go in
herds of about the same number as do the greater koodoos.
Old bucks are nearly black, and the horns become smooth by
rubbing against trees; and scars of all sorts remain on the
neck, being the result of wild rushes through the jungle or
fights with other bucks. The average length of a good buck’s
horns is about 25 inches from base to tip. The longest I have
shot or seen was between 27 and 28 inches in length in a
straight line. The horns are very sharp, but I have never seen
a lesser koodoo attempt to charge.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Somáli Hartebeest</span> (<i>Bubalis swaynei</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Síg</i></p>

<p>The <i>Síg</i> or hartebeest was described by Dr. Sclater as
<i>Bubalis swaynei</i>; his description and notes (P. Z. S., Feb. 1892)
were taken from specimens shot and sent home by me. I was
not the first to shoot the <i>Síg</i>, but mine were the first specimens
submitted to scientific investigation.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;" id="illus42">
<img src="images/illus42.jpg" width="400" height="460" alt="" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Somáli Hartebeest</span> (<i>Bubalis swaynei</i>).</p>
<p class="caption">Length of horns on curve, 20¼ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>South of Gólis Range, and at a distance of about one hundred
and twenty miles from the coast, are open plains from four to
six thousand feet above sea-level, alternating with broken ground
covered with thorn jungle. These patches of <i>ban</i> or prairie are the
only kind of country where the hartebeest is to be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
Not a bush is to be seen, and some of these plains are thirty
or forty miles in extent.</p>

<p>I first saw the <i>Síg</i> when coming on to ground which had
not then been visited by Europeans, and found one of these
plains covered with hartebeests, there being perhaps a dozen
herds in sight at one time, each containing three or four
hundred of these antelopes. Hundreds of bulls were scattered
singly on the outskirts and in spaces between the herds,
grazing, fighting, or lying down. The scene described was
at a distance of over a hundred and twenty miles from
Berbera.</p>

<p>The hartebeest bulls are very pugnacious, and two or
three couples may be fighting round the same herd at once.
Perhaps the easiest way to get a specimen is to send a couple
of Midgáns round above the wind to drive them towards you,
at the same time lying down in the grass. In this way a shot
may be got within a hundred yards, but no one would care to
shoot very many hartebeests, except for food. There is no
chance of creeping up to hartebeests unless the huge ant-hills,
often twenty-five feet high, are conveniently situated.</p>

<p>Often oryx and Sœmmering’s gazelles are seen in company
with these great troops of hartebeests, but the oryx are much
wilder. The hartebeests are rather tame, and they and the
Sœmmering’s gazelles are always the last to move away.
Hartebeests have great curiosity, and will frequently rush round
a caravan, halting now and then within two hundred yards to gaze.
This sight is an extraordinary one, all the antelopes having
heavy and powerful fore-quarters, while the hind-quarters are
poor and fall away; the coat is glossy like that of a well-groomed
horse. In the midday haze of the plains they look
something like troops of lions, as the powerful head and neck
are of a different shade of chestnut to the rest of the body.
The pace of the hartebeest is an ungraceful, lumbering canter,
but it is probably the fleetest and most enduring of the Somáli
antelopes. The largest herd I have seen must have contained
a thousand individuals, packed closely together, and looking
like a regiment of cavalry, the whole plain round being dotted
with single bulls.</p>

<p>From their living so much in the open plains the hartebeests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
must subsist entirely on grass, for there is nothing else
to eat; and they must be able to exist for several days without
water. They are the favourite food of lions, and once, when
out with my brother, I found a troop of three lions sitting out
on the open plains, ten miles from the nearest bush; they had
evidently been out all night among the herds, and on their
becoming gorged, the rising sun had found them disinclined to
move.</p>

<p>The hartebeest is about as large as a donkey. The horns
vary greatly in shape and size; there are the short massive
horns and the long pointed ones, and all the variations between.
Some curve forward, with the points thrown back; others curve
outwards in the same plane with the forehead, the points turning
inward. I never heard of hartebeests in the whole of Guban or
anywhere in the parts of Ogádén which I have visited; I have
seen them on open plains in the Haud and Ogo, and nowhere else.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Waterbuck</span> (<i>Cobus ellipsiprymnus</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Balanka</i>, among the Adone (Webbe negroes); corrupted to <i>Balango</i>
by the Somális</p>

<p>I believe there are no waterbuck to be found in Somáliland
except on the banks of the Webbe Shabéleh, and perhaps
the Lower Nogal, near the east coast. There are none on the
Tug Fáfan, at any of the points where I have crossed it. They
are said to be numerous all along the Webbe Ganána (Juba),
the course of which lies chiefly through Gállaland.</p>

<p>The first important collections of the waterbuck were, I
think, made by Colonel Arthur Paget and myself on two
independent but simultaneous expeditions to the Webbe last
spring. I found these antelopes very plentiful all along both
banks of the river, from Imé down to Burka in the Aulihán
tribe, which was as far as I followed the stream. They lie up
in the dense forest which clothes both banks of the river for
some two hundred yards from the water’s edge; and they go
out to feed in the open grass flats outside the belts of forest.
They go in small herds of about fifteen individuals, though
most of the herds I saw consisted of only four or five, with one
old buck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The habits of the Somáli waterbuck are, I believe, similar
to those of the same species in other parts of Africa. They
feed chiefly on grass, delight in a mud-bath, and take to the
water readily; a wounded buck which I was following in thick
forest tried to escape by swimming the Webbe, some ninety
yards across, and we shot him as he galloped along the farther
bank. The bucks on the Webbe vary much in colour, from
brownish gray to nearly black. The white lunate marking over
the tail is always present; some heads have the forehead
bright rufous brown, and others are nearly black in this part.
The flesh is eaten by the negroes of the Webbe, but not by
Somális. The horns obtained on the Webbe are small compared
to waterbuck horns from more southern Africa; out of
some fifteen heads of old bucks collected by me at different
times none reached twenty-five inches. The females are hornless.
The waterbuck is about the size of a red-deer, and
resembles the latter in the shape of the head, though the body
stands on shorter and stouter legs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Bushbuck</span> (<i>Tragelaphus decula</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Dól</i></p>

<p>The bushbuck is somewhat larger than a fallow deer, and is
common in the dense forest on the Webbe banks; and it is the
most wary and difficult to shoot of all the game animals I have
ever encountered. I never heard of its existence till my second
expedition to the Webbe last autumn. At Karanleh I obtained
from the natives several skins and horns of <i>Dól</i> which had been
caught by means of disguised pits, with a stake in the bottom
of each. These pits are made by the Adone, and are funnel-shaped,
about eight feet deep and five in diameter at the top.
They are dug in the densest jungle, in the paths most frequented
by the bushbuck when going to and returning from the water.
Some of these paths are long tunnels three feet high, bored
through the masses of vegetation for fifty yards or more, and
often I could only get to the river by creeping on all-fours
through these tunnels; this may be exciting work when it is
considered that many kinds of game, including the lion and
rhinoceros, use them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bushbuck or Decula Antelope</span> (<i>Tragelaphus decula</i>).</p>
<p class="caption">Length of horns, 16 inches.</p>
</div>

<p>On my arrival at Karanleh I sent skilled negroes to repair
all the pits within a mile or two of my camp, in the hope of
getting a specimen. During a month spent on the Webbe banks
I shot only one young buck, but I organised three or four drives,
in one of which my men shot a buck with their Sniders. On
this occasion the buck was in company with one female, which
broke back through the line in spite of the firing, and in rather
a curious manner, which I have before described. The only
way of crossing the line was to jump over the head of one of
my men who was standing erect, which she did, her hoofs
striking the centre of his forehead and knocking him down.
This is probably, as elsewhere in Africa, a plucky little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
antelope, and its hunting in the dense bush which it inhabits
is not altogether free from danger.</p>

<p>The longest horns were a pair which I picked up, measuring
about seventeen inches in length. The females are hornless.
The young of both sexes are of a distinct reddish
brown, getting darker as they grow older, and the natives say
the old bucks become nearly black. The hair is generally
curiously worn off along the spine. The natives have given
me conflicting theories, but I cannot satisfactorily account for
it. There are four or five transverse white stripes and white
spots, sometimes as many as thirty, on each side, more numerous
in the young animals. The necks are scantily covered with
short hair, and in the two young bucks we killed were very
slender. The flesh is good eating. I am not aware that the
bushbuck exists anywhere in Somáliland but in the dense
forest close to the banks of the Webbe.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Clarke’s Gazelle</span> (<i>Ammodorcas clarkei</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Dibatag</i> or <i>Diptag</i></p>

<p>The <i>Dibatag</i> was first shot by Mr. T. W. H. Clarke in 1891
during his exploring trip to the Dolbahanta and Marehán
countries, far to the south-east of Berbera. Just a week after
his specimens had been sent to England, I bought in Berbera
two pairs of horns with the face skins attached, and sent them
to Dr. Sclater, of the Zoological Society, believing them to
belong to a new antelope; but by this time Mr. Clarke’s
specimens had been examined by Mr. Rowland Ward and
handed to Mr. Oldfield Thomas, who described this new
species. See <cite>Proceedings</cite>, Zoological Society, March 1891.</p>

<p>The <i>Dibatag</i> is common enough in some parts, but is very
local in its distribution. Since Mr. Clarke first discovered it,
a few have been met with and shot by sportsmen in the
eastern parts of the Haud waterless plateau.</p>

<p>I have been singularly unfortunate with this antelope,
never having been in the country where it is found till I went
to the Nogal Valley some three years ago. At that time the
<i>Jilal</i>, or dry season, was at its height, and all game was scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
and shy, so I never got a <i>Dibatag</i> till June 1893, when on my
return journey from Ogádén across the waterless plateau I made
a détour of several days to
the east on purpose to shoot
one for my collection.</p>

<p>I searched for <i>Dibatag</i>
at Tur, a jungle due south
of Toyo grass plains, the
distance being some eighty
miles from Berbera, and was
lucky in getting one good
buck and picking up two
pairs of horns, although I
saw a good many, but all
were wild and shy. This
is their extreme western
limit, and they never by
any chance, I believe, come
so far south as the Gólis
Range. Farther east, towards
Bur’o, they are more
plentiful and less shy.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;" id="illus44">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Clarke’s Gazelle</span> (<i>Ammodorcas clarkei</i>).</p>
<p class="caption">Length of horns on curve, 9¾ inches.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Dibatag</i> are very difficult
to see, their purplish
gray colour matching with
the high <i>durr</i> grass in
the glades where they are
found. The glossy coat,
shining, reflects the surrounding colours, making it sometimes
almost invisible; and at the best of times its slender body is
hard to make out. I have often mistaken female Waller’s
gazelles for <i>Dibatag</i>, and once shot one of the former in mistake
for the latter. The habits and gait are much the same, save
that the <i>Dibatag</i> trots off with head held up, and the long tail
held erect over the back nearly meeting the head, while Waller’s
gazelle trots away with its head down and its short tail screwed
round. Like Waller’s gazelle, the <i>Dibatag</i> goes singly or in
pairs, or small families up to half a dozen.</p>

<p>As is the case with Waller’s gazelle, the <i>Dibatag</i> is enabled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
by its long neck and rather long upper lip to reach down branches
of the mimósa bushes from a considerable height. The shape of
head and way of feeding of both antelopes are giraffe-like, and
I have seen both standing on the hind legs, fore-feet planted
against the trunk of a tree, when feeding, an illustration of
which is given. I have seen <i>Dibatag</i> feeding both on thorn-bushes
and on the <i>durr</i> grass. Both Walleri and Clarke’s
antelopes can live far from water. The country most suitable
for <i>Dibatag</i> is jungle of the <i>khansa</i> or umbrella mimósa,
alternating with glades of <i>durr</i> grass, which grows about six
feet high. The females are hornless. The <i>Dibatag</i> is a very
graceful antelope, standing higher than an Indian blackbuck,
but weighing probably a good deal less.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Waller’s Gazelle</span> (<i>Lithocranius walleri</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Gerenúk</i></p>

<p>The <i>Gerenúk</i> is the commonest and most widely distributed
of the Somáli antelopes except the little <i>Sakáro</i>, which springs
like a hare from every thicket.</p>

<p>The long neck of the <i>Gerenúk</i>, large giraffe-like eyes,
and long muzzle, are peculiar to it and the <i>Dibatag</i>
(<i>Ammodorcas clarkei</i>). The <i>Gerenúk</i> is more of a browser of
bushes than a grass-feeder, and I have twice shot it in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
act of standing on the hind legs, neck extended, and fore-feet
against the trunk of a tree, reaching down the tender shoots,
which could not be got in any other way. Thus not only the
appearance, but the habits of the <i>Gerenúk</i> are giraffe-like. The
skull extends far back behind the ears like that of a camel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;" id="illus46">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Waller’s Gazelle</span> (<i>Lithocranius walleri</i>).</p>
<p class="caption">Length of horns on curve, 15⅜ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>It is found all over the Somáli country in small families,
never in large herds, and generally in scattered bush, ravines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
and rocky ground. I think it subsists almost entirely on
bushes, as it is constantly found in places deserted by oryx and
all other antelopes because there was no grass. Perhaps the
Gadabursi country is the best ground, but the <i>Gerenúk</i> is almost
ubiquitous and need not be specially looked for. I have never
seen it in the cedar forests which crown Gólis, nor in the
treeless plains which occur in the Haud. It is not necessarily
found near water,—in fact, generally on stony ground with a
sprinkling of thorn jungle.</p>

<p>The gait of this antelope is peculiar, and when first seen
a buck will generally be standing motionless, head well up,
looking at the intruder and trusting to its invisibility. Then
the head dives under the bushes, and the animal goes off at a
long crouching trot, stopping now and again behind some
bush to gaze. It seldom gallops, and its pace is never very
fast. In the whole shape of the head and neck, with its extended
muzzle and slender lower jaw, there is a marked resemblance
between the <i>Gerenúk</i> and the <i>Dibatag</i>. The texture of
the coat is much alike in both. The horns of immature buck
<i>Gerenúk</i> have almost exactly the same shape as those of the
<i>Dibatag</i>. The average length of Waller’s gazelle horns is about
thirteen inches. The females are hornless; they sometimes
lose or desert their young ones, as I have now and then come
on fawns living alone in the jungle. The <i>Gerenúk</i> stands a
good deal higher than an Indian blackbuck, but would be
about the same weight.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sœmmering’s Gazelle</span> (<i>Gazella sœmmeringi</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Aoul</i></p>

<p>Five years ago, when I was staying in the quarters at Bulhár,
the <i>Aoul</i> could be seen from the bungalow grazing out on
the plain. The Bulhár Maritime Plain used to be full of them,
but they have been so persecuted by sportsmen that they have
now retired to some distance. The bush in the Bulhár Plain
is delightful for sport when not overrun by the Somáli flocks
and herds. In the <i>Haga</i>, or summer, Bulhár is nearly empty.
The walking under-foot is very thorny, owing to a practice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
vogue with Somális of scattering thorny brushwood about the
ground across certain paths, to prevent the straying of the
animals. Some of the thorns are four inches long, and soon
find out a hole in the boot.</p>

<p>The <i>Aoul</i> weighs about the same as the <i>Gerenúk</i>, but has
a shorter neck and a more clumsy-looking head, and is altogether
a coarser animal. It is a grass-feeder, and lives in the open
plains or in scattered bush, and never in thick jungle, and
prefers tolerably flat ground. The white hind-quarters can be
seen from a great distance, making a herd look like a flock of
sheep in the haze of the plains. I have never seen them in
the cedar forests on the top of Gólis, but in the hartebeest
ground to the south they are common, and may often be seen
in very large herds along with the hartebeests, and are very
common all over the Haud and Ogádén and near the Webbe.</p>

<p>They are, I think, the most stupid and easy to shoot of all
the Somáli antelopes, and their habits are identical with those
of the Indian blackbuck, but they are not equal to it in beauty
and grace of movement. <i>Aoul</i> often make long and high jumps
when going away, presumably to look over the backs of the
others; they look something like specimens of the Cape springbuck
which I have seen in England. I have never observed
them spring vertically to a great height, as the Indian blackbuck
does. They are inquisitive like the hartebeests, and will
follow a caravan in the open; and if fired at, they make off
across the front, stretching themselves out at racing speed, and
drawing up in a troop now and then to gaze.</p>

<p>If much meat is required, it is easy in scattered bush for a
man on foot to run into a large herd and shoot several. The
bucks will often be seen fighting or chasing each other at
full speed. Solitary bucks are sometimes found, and I once
saw about fifteen young fawns gathered together a mile away
from the adult herd. The largest herd I have ever seen in the
Bulhár Plain contained about two hundred individuals, but I
have seen over a thousand together in the open plains of the
Haud.</p>

<p><i>Aoul</i> can live a long way from water. Near the coast they
often come down close to the shore, possibly to lick the salt
pebbles. A wounded buck does not hide, but will lie down in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
the most open spot he can find, and there will generally be a
circle of jackals waiting round him. They can sometimes be
easily shot at dusk, when they are apt to blunder close to a
caravan. The horns vary in shape, and are often malformed
or wanting in symmetry, being generally lyrate, the points
turning inwards and forwards. The largest pair I have seen
measured seventeen inches, following the curve; the average
is about fourteen inches.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Guban or Lowland Gazelle</span> (<i>Gazella pelzelni</i>).</h3>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Ogo or Plateau Gazelle</span> (<i>Gazella spekei</i>).</h3>

<p class="center">Native name for either variety, <i>Déro</i></p>

<p>The Plateau gazelle, which has the ridges of loose skin
over the nose well developed, inhabits the elevated country,
commencing about thirty-five miles inland. It is found south
of Gólis, in Ogo and in the Haud, as well as in Ogo-Gudan,
the country near Hargeisa where Guban rises gradually into
Ogo.</p>

<p>I have shot large numbers of gazelles for food at various
times, and have always noticed that the Plateau variety has a
much thicker and longer coat than the other. This is possibly
the result of natural selection, as the high plains of Ogo and the
Haud, where it lives, are subject to sweeping cold winds, and
the nights are very cold indeed. The altitude of these plains
inhabited by the Plateau gazelle is from three thousand to over
six thousand feet, but doubtless they go much lower towards
Ogádén. The great step of Gólis, with its prolongations east
and west, which rises some forty miles inland and separates
Guban, the low coast country, from Ogo, the high interior
country, forms the natural line of demarcation between these
two gazelles.</p>

<p>The short-coated, light-coloured Lowland gazelle, which resembles
the former in size, is found below in Guban, to the north
of Gólis. I have generally observed that the gazelles of the low
country carried rather longer horns than those of the Plateau
gazelle, which are shorter, thicker, more curved, and better annulated.
The habits of both are alike. They go in moderate herds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
of from three up to about ten, and are fond of stony or sandy
undulating ground and ravines, thinly dotted over with mimósas.
Both varieties are fond of salt, and do not want water, and it
is hard to understand what they can pick up to eat in the
wretched ground frequented by them. They generally avoid
thick bush, and have curiosity which amounts to impudence,
but are wonderfully on the alert and hard to shoot, seeming to
know perfectly well the range of a rifle, and presenting a small
target.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Klipspringer</span> (<i>Oreotragus saltator</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Somáli name, <i>Alakud</i></p>

<p>These small antelopes live in the most rugged mountains,
poising themselves on large boulders and leaping from rock to
rock. They are neither shy nor hard to shoot. Gólis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Assa Ranges, and the hills near Gebili, are the best ground in
which to look for them. <i>Alakud</i> go in twos and threes. The
longest horns I saw in Somáliland were about three and a half
inches in length. The females are hornless. The coat is very
coarse, resembling that of no other Somáli antelope, the hairs
being almost like quills, and so loosely planted in the skin that
it is difficult to preserve a specimen. The hoofs are also
peculiar, being nearly cylindrical, and cup-shaped underneath,
no doubt in order, by cushioning the air, to break the fall and
to give an extra firm hold on the rocks.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The “Dik-Dik” Antelopes</span></h3>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 25em;">
<ul>
<li><i>Sakáro Guyu</i> (<i>Madoqua swaynei</i>)</li>
<li><i>Sakáro Gol Ass</i> (<i>Madoqua phillipsi</i>)</li>
<li><i>Sakáro Gussuli</i> (<i>Madoqua guentheri</i>)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="center">General native name, <i>Sakáro</i></p>

<p>These little antelopes weigh less than an English hare, and
I think <i>Guyu</i> must be among the smallest of the antelope tribe.
In all three the horns are well corrugated at the base, sharply
pointed, and from one inch to three inches long. The eyes
are enormously large in proportion to the size of the head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>Gol Ass</i> (<i>i.e.</i> “red belly”) is the ordinary “Dik-Dik,”
which is shot all over Guban and Ogo and in parts of the
Haud and Ogádén. The <i>Guyu</i> differs from it in being very
much smaller, and having the sides of the belly yellowish gray
instead of reddish yellow. It appears to be found in the
localities frequented by the <i>Gol Ass</i>. In fact both have been
shot indiscriminately by sportsmen under the name “Dik-Dik,”
which is the term used by Europeans, who often noticed the
great variation in the size of adult specimens. My attention
was first called to the two native names only at the end of my
last expedition, which led to the discovery that they represented
distinct varieties.</p>

<p class="caption">Length of horns, 2½ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>I came on <i>Gussuli</i> for the first time about a day’s journey
south of Seyyid Mahomed’s village in the Malingúr tribe,
and found it to exist all over the Rer Amáden country. Its
range coincides nearly with that of the rhinoceros, and it is
found, like the latter animal, in parts of the Haud, where its
ground overlaps with the range of the <i>Gol Ass.</i> The <i>Gussuli</i>
is if anything slightly larger than the <i>Gol Ass</i>, and of a dead
gray colour, with a white belly. The female appears to be
much larger than the male; and it is a pretty safe rule, when
trying to shoot the buck of a pair, to aim at the smaller one.</p>

<p>The <i>Gol Ass</i> and <i>Guyu</i> have short muzzles, while that of
the <i>Gussuli</i> is very long, resembling the snout of a tapir.
The two former antelopes are found in pairs, seldom more than
three being seen together. They give a shrill alarm whistle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
uttered two or three times in quick succession, and are often a
nuisance, being apt to disturb more valuable game. The
<i>Gussuli</i> start up three or four at a time, and sometimes the
undergrowth seems to be alive with them. These small
antelopes are very easily knocked over with a shot gun and
No. 4 shot. They give good sport in the evening, when they
are liveliest, especially if followed silently and fired at with a
rook rifle, for they give plenty of chances when they stand to
look back. The female exposes herself most, and is consequently
most often shot.</p>

<p class="caption">Dik-Dik and Aloes</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gol Ass</span> (<i>Madoqua phillipsi</i>).</p>
</div>

<p>All <i>Sakáro</i> prefer broken ground, where there is good cover
of low scrub or aloes, and they are never seen in open grass
plains. They lie close like hares, and when disturbed dart out
with successive hops, at a great pace. I have often seen about
eighty <i>Sakáro</i> in the course of a day’s march. They nibble the
young shoots of the low <i>khansa</i> and other bushes; and like to
be near water, going to drink at midday and just after nightfall.</p>

<p>Every traveller going to Somáliland has brought back
specimens of the little <i>Sakáro</i> antelope, called by Europeans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
indiscriminately the “Dik-Dik,” but I had noticed that the
Somális recognised three kinds—the <i>Guyu</i>, <i>Gol Ass</i>, and <i>Gussuli</i>.
After my second Webbe trip I collected specimens which, with
those already collected by Mr. Lort Phillips and other sportsmen,
enabled Mr. Oldfield Thomas to ascertain that all three
were new; and they were then described by him (P. Z. S. April
1894), and called respectively <i>Madoqua swaynei</i>, <i>Madoqua
phillipsi</i>, and <i>Madoqua guentheri</i>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The “Baira” Antelope</span> (<i>Oreotragus megalotis</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Baira</i></p>

<p>The <i>Baira</i> antelope, which my brother and I believed to
be new, was described by Herr Menges (<cite>Zool. Anz.</cite> xvii. 1894),
and called <i>Oreotragus megalotis</i>. Specimens had been submitted
by me to Mr. Oldfield Thomas, and he had pronounced
it to be new a few days before Herr Menges brought his
specimens forward in Germany for the purposes of description.</p>

<p>I first heard of it near Ali-Maan, in the Gadabursi
country, among very rugged hills, in the autumn of 1891,
when my brother saw two of them, but failed to get a shot.
He described them as reddish antelopes, rather larger than the
klipspringer, with small straight horns, bounding away among
the rocks in exactly the same manner as the klipspringer.</p>

<p>On my last trip the Somális assured me that I should
find them on Wagar Mountain and on Negegr, which is its
eastern continuation, lying about forty miles south-south-east
of Berbera, and rising to between six and seven thousand feet.
They said it was nearly as large as an ordinary Plateau gazelle,
but reddish; also that it inhabited ground similar to the klipspringer,
but was shy and difficult to shoot. This no doubt
accounts for no Englishman having shot one, though my brother
heard of them so far back as 1891. I could not shoot one, as I
had no time to go again to Wagar myself. On leaving the coast
on my last trip I sent men in to look for <i>Baira</i>, offering a
reward for a good head and skin of a male and female, and
gave instructions to my agents in Berbera and Aden to pay the
reward and to send me the specimens. Lately I received the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
two skins and pairs of horns from Aden, and when I submitted
them for scientific investigation in London, it transpired that
the antelope was new and had just been described.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Grévy’s Zebra</span> (<i>Equus grévyi</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Somáli name, <i>Fer’o</i></p>

<p>Grévy’s zebra was, I believe, described by the French from
a zoological garden specimen, but first shot in Somáliland by
Colonel Paget and myself on our simultaneous expeditions
early in 1893. I found them at Durhi, in Central Ogádén,
between the Tug Fáfan and the Webbe, and about three hundred
miles inland from Berbera, and shot seven specimens, all
of which were eaten by myself and my thirty followers; in fact,
for many days we had no other food, although this was no
hardship, for the meat is better than that of most of the antelopes,
and is highly prized by the Rer Amáden and Malingúr
tribes.</p>

<p>The zebra was very common in the territory of these two
tribes. The country there is covered with scattered bush over
its entire surface, and is stony and much broken up by ravines;
the general elevation is about two thousand five hundred feet
above sea-level. Those which I saw (probably not more than
two hundred in all) were met with in small droves of about
half a dozen, on low plateaux covered with scattered thorn bush
and glades of <i>durr</i> grass, the soil being powdery, and red in colour,
with an occasional outcrop of rocks. In this sort of country they
are very easy to stalk, and I should never have fired at them for
sport alone. I saw none in the open flats of the Webbe Valley,
and they never come nearly so far north as the open grass
plains of the Haud, Durhi south of the Fáfan being, I think,
their northern limit. The young have longer coats and the
stripes are rather lighter brown, turning later on to a deep
chocolate, which is nearly black in adult animals.</p>

<p>On one occasion, after firing at one of a drove of zebras, I
was sorry to find, on going up to it, that it was a female, and
that its foal was standing by the body, refusing to run away,
though the rest had all gone. We crept up to within ten yards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of it, and made an unsuccessful attempt to noose it with a rope
weighted by bullets, but it made off after the first try. We
must have been quite five minutes standing within ten yards
of it in the thick bush, while preparing the noose.</p>

<p>Zebras are very inquisitive; when we were encamped for
some days at Eil-Fúd, in the Rer Amáden country, the zebras
used to come at night and bray and stamp round our camp,
and were answered by my Abyssinian mule. The sounds made
by the two animals are somewhat similar.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wild Ass</span> (<i>Equus nubianus somálicus</i>)</h3>

<p class="center">Native name, <i>Gumburi</i></p>

<p>The wild ass is common in sterile parts of Guban, especially
to the east of Berbera. In Ogádén its place is taken by the
zebra. It is a fine animal and has striped legs. It can scarcely
be considered as fair game to the sportsman.</p>

<p>Leopards (<i>Shabél</i>) are very abundant in Somáliland, and are
the great scourge of the shepherds. They spring into karias
at night without the slightest fear, and nearly all the losses
among sheep and goats are caused either by leopards or hyænas.
On Gólis Range, round Mandeira, they are especially common,
and it is not an unusual thing to hear them coughing by day
from the shelter of some cave high up among the mountains.
The sound is most like that of a saw being drawn to and fro
through a plank, only much deeper, and can be heard at a
great distance. Leopards are so stealthy that they are seldom
seen by day. The best way to kill one is to wait about among
the tribes near the foot of the mountains, and having found a
karia that is particularly favoured by them, to construct a
shelter and tie up a goat, preferably a half-grown one which
will bleat; if the leopard charges the goat, it is best to wait
till he is quietly lying over the victim drinking its blood,
offering a certain shot. Another way is to find out the cave
where the leopard lives, and to tie up a goat just before dusk
and sit over it for half an hour.</p>

<p>Leopards are found in all kinds of ground, and not necessarily
in hilly country. I have had them spring into my camp
more than a dozen times, and once one which could not get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
over our high zeríba in any other way, ran along the branch
of a tree under which our camp had been pitched, and dropped
perpendicularly down among us, close to the goats; luckily he
was driven off in time by the sentry. Many goats have been
killed inside my camp by leopards.</p>

<p class="caption">Outside width in a straight line across tusks, 12¼ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>Wart-hogs (<i>Phacochœrus æthiopicus</i>) called <i>Dófar</i> by the
Somális, are common, especially along the base of Gólis. Most
of the ground which they inhabit is not suitable for hard riding,
so when they have exceptionally fine tusks they are shot. The
Somáli, being a good Mussulman, will neither touch a dead wart-hog
nor the knife which has been used in cutting off the head;
and if tempted by a fine pair of tusks to kill a wart-hog, the
traveller must be ready to tackle this job himself. It is tough
work skinning the head, and it is annoying to have to hang the
tin box or bucket, in which the skull has been packed, daily on
a camel, to say nothing of preserving the head and cleaning the
skull. I have always done this work myself with as pleasant a
face as possible, in spite of strong looks of disapproval from
the natives; and the few curious wart-hog skulls which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
brought home well repaid me for my labour. It is worth knowing
that a Midgán or a starving Somáli may sometimes be
bribed to do this unclean work, provided no one is looking on
and the matter is kept a secret.</p>

<p>Ostriches (<i>Goreiyu</i>) are occasionally seen in level plains all
over the country, especially where the bush is not very thick.
They are only numerous in the open prairies. They are
terribly shy, and the best rifle to take in hand on seeing an
ostrich is the Lee-Metford. As a rule they are seen running
along at a great pace at a distance of between eight hundred
yards and a mile away,
having seen the human
beings first. Or they
stand perfectly still, with
their bodies under cover
and their small heads looking
over the top of a bush
if there is one to be found.
In all our journeys my
brother and I only succeeded
in shooting one
cock ostrich each.</p>

<p class="caption">Length of horns on curve, 11¾ inches.</p>
</div>

<p>In 1891, on the plain
south of the Miríya Pass,
my brother and I witnessed
an instance of the manner
in which Midgáns hunt the
ostrich. We saw an ostrich
and its half-grown chick walking over the bare plain, followed
by an unladen camel, behind which were stalking the Midgáns.
They said that they had been after the birds since the morning
of the day before, and having already killed the female, hoped
to get the male bird then or on the following day, and if successful
they would catch and rear up the young one. Ostriches
are said to be often shot by following them on horseback, the
riders being placed in relays along the probable line of flight.
They are kept moving by day to prevent their feeding, for they
cannot see to move or feed by night, so that in a few days they
become weak and are thus easily ridden down. Midgáns often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
keep a few of them tame, no doubt mostly caught when very
young, but I have never seen ostrich farming on a large scale
in Somáliland.</p>

<p>The spotted hyæna (<i>Warába</i>) is very common, and the
striped hyæna (<i>Didar</i>) rather rare. There is a wild dog called
<i>Yei</i>, which the natives say hunts in packs, but I have never
seen one. Spotted hyænas prowl round the zeríba of the
traveller every night, looking for scraps of meat. I have had
goats carried off by them when tethered to the zeríba. Among
the karias they sometimes carry off children and kill women,
and men found asleep by them alone in the bush are often
attacked, the face being nearly always seized and a large piece
torn away. So voracious is the hyæna that it often pulls off
the tail of a camel or the udder of a cow.</p>

<p>Crocodiles (<i>Jaház</i>) swarm in the Webbe Shabéleh river.
There are a few schools of hippopotami (<i>Jér</i>) one of which had
its usual abode near Sen Morettu, but I failed to find it, only
coming upon the fresh tracks.</p>

<p>There are giraffes (<i>Giri</i> or <i>Halgiri</i>) in the Aulihán country,
three days from Burka on the Webbe, but I gave them up for
the chance of going to the Arussi Gállas.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This differs from the
South African giraffe in its markings. The South African form
is more spotted; the Somáli form has lighter markings, and
the patches of colour are divided into more hexagonal and sexagonal
shapes, as pointed out in a letter to the <cite>Field</cite> by Mr.
Rowland Ward in February 1894, who there gave a description
of the first one shot in Somáliland by Major C. E. W. Wood.</p>

<p>While on the Webbe I was informed that four buffalo
(<i>Jámus</i>), all bulls, had strayed from the Geriré Gálla country
through eighty miles of bush, and had taken up their abode in
the forest on the Webbe banks at Sen Morettu, four years before
my visit to that spot. My informant, a Gilimiss Somáli, told
me that his father had killed two of them two years before
with poisoned arrows, and that two remained. I found their
fresh tracks, the first I had ever seen, and tried very hard for
a whole day to get a sight of them. We put them up eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
times at a few yards’ distance in the fearfully dense forest
without once seeing them, and when we organised a drive
next day they broke through the line of beaters and got away,
making for the distant Gálla hills. These are the only
buffalo I ever heard of in Somáliland. They are said by
the Gállas to be plentiful on the Webbe Wéb, a tributary of
the Juba, four days distant from Karanleh.</p>

<p>Baboons (<i>Dáyer</i>) are occasionally seen in the rocks round
the river-beds, especially in different parts of Guban. My first
meeting with these animals was an interesting experience. It
was when on my first surveying expedition, and while encamped
at Aleyaláleh on the Issutugan river, with an escort of Indian
cavalry and mounted police, that I first saw baboons. At this
spot the river cuts deeply into a plateau, forming a gully two
or three hundred feet deep. A troop of some two hundred
baboons came down towards evening from the cliffs, on their
way to drink at the stream. Several of the old males were
nearly as large as retriever dogs, and had handsome gray manes,
which at dusk gave them the appearance of lions. There were
several females carrying young ones on their backs, and as the
long strings of baboons climbed along the narrow ledges, they
kept up a hoarse barking which sounded very like language,
and could be heard from a great distance echoing among the
hills. They are savage brutes, and take up positions as if to
dispute the passage of any one climbing the cliffs; and I have
no doubt, with his long teeth and great strength, one of the
old males could kill an unarmed man if so disposed.</p>

<p>I had given the troopers some spare cartridges to amuse
themselves with, by taking shots at marks, and the native
officer, who had been strolling about below the cliffs, fired a
shot at an old male baboon and brought him down. I was in
camp, and on hearing a hot fire going on, ran out, thinking we
were attacked by raiders. It transpired that an Arab camelman
had been sent up to the base of the cliffs to get the body
of the baboon, and had been attacked by the whole troop from
above, having to beat a hasty retreat under cover of the fire
from several Sniders, and on my joining the men, another male
fell to my Express, tumbling perpendicularly nearly fifty feet
down the cliffs. When at last we secured the carcases, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
struck by their wonderfully human-like appearance, and I have
never again brought myself to shoot a monkey. I have seen
baboons scores of times since, and have never molested them,
and as they soon get over their shyness and fear of man, I have
been able to watch their habits closely.</p>

<p class="caption">Length of horns on curve, average 9 inches.</p>
</div>

<p>Besides these maned baboons, we found in the belt of forest
on the Webbe banks a maneless baboon and a small tree
monkey. In parts of this forest the monkeys and baboons
simply swarm. They spring about everywhere above and
around the traveller, and the stench is nearly unbearable.</p>

<p>Among game birds the most noticeable are three varieties
of the bustard tribe (<i>Salalmadli</i>), three varieties of guinea-fowl
(<i>Digirin</i>), partridges, sand grouse, and a wild goose in
Ogádén. Birds of prey are very conspicuous, there being at
least two kinds of vultures (<i>Gur-Gur</i>) and a small black and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
white eagle, kites, ravens, and the great black and white
carrion storks, which stand about four feet high and have very
large orange-coloured beaks.</p>

<p>Jackals (<i>Dowáo</i>), with black and silver backs, are very
common; also foxes, a small variety of hare (<i>Bokheila</i>), a badger
very like the English kind, two kinds of squirrel, gray and brown
(<i>Dabergáli</i>), and the curious little rock-rabbits (<i>Bauna</i>). There
is a mouse-coloured animal of the ferret kind (<i>Shók-Shók</i>),
which lives under the roots of trees and hunts in packs. Snakes
are numerous, three kinds most often met with being an adder
(<i>abeso</i>), a variegated rock snake (<i>abguri</i>), and a black snake called
<i>muss</i>, all of which are said to be very deadly. There is also a
lizard nearly four feet long. Among the insects may be mentioned
mosquitoes (<i>Kan-ád</i>)—they are only troublesome, however,
on the Webbe and in the Esa and Gadabursi countries;
two kinds of gadfly; a large spider (<i>Hangeyu</i>), which produces
a web almost exactly like golden silk, which can be found in
any old zeríba in the Haud; scorpions, and two kinds of
centipede (<i>Hangagári</i>).</p>

<p>For an English sportsman, Somáliland is probably the best hunting-ground
in Africa. The climate is healthy, and not too hot in the higher
districts; the English are universally popular, and the natives appreciate
sport. The caravan, when once properly provisioned at the coast,
renders one entirely independent in a country practically without
villages or supplies. The game is shy and not too easy to get, which
is an advantage from a sporting point of view. There is room for
many simultaneous expeditions if they are only pushed into unexplored
ground, and a great variety of game is found within a limited area.
Above all, there is easy access to the Somáli coast from civilised parts.</p>

<p>I have been asked so often to give information to intending travellers
to Somáliland that, for the guidance of those who contemplate visiting
that country, I venture to publish the following suggestions.</p>

<p>It is, of course, not to be expected that every traveller can share the
same views on subjects connected with the fitting out of an expedition;
but by way of illustration I shall calculate a few examples of the caravans
which I would myself organise for certain definite objects. Whether
the intending traveller agree with me or not, he will at least gain an insight
into some of the more necessary details connected with the needs
and precautions attendant upon the fitting out and conducting of caravans
into the interior of Somáliland.</p>

<p>To begin with, if there are two or more Europeans in an expedition,
in my opinion each should have his own caravan complete. There are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
several reasons for this. Where there are two or three Europeans with
a combined caravan of mixed servants, it is difficult to ensure that
equal loyalty shall be extended by the Somális to each member of the
party. Interests clash, and the result has, according to all I have
heard, too often been a spoilt trip. In my journeys with my brother
the value of distinctly organised caravans was recognised at once, and
we held to this system throughout, the result being that even our
servants and camelmen pulled well together, and we had no caravan
difficulties.</p>

<p>It is convenient in safe country, when an increase of sport can be
obtained thereby, for the different Europeans to separate. Thus A
hears of a lion two days’ march away; B goes three days’ march in the
opposite direction to search a valley believed to contain elephants; C
forms a camp in the hills twenty miles away for a week’s koodoo shooting.
In unsafe country, or where there is sport for all at one spot, the
camps may be reunited, the dinners clubbed together, the tents pitched
side by side, and the camels joined into one herd. But the distinct
organisation of each caravan should be preserved, under the command
of its own white leader, assisted by his Somáli headman. In this way
only, with the maximum of supervision, aided by a feeling of <i>esprit de
corps</i> between the different caravans, can the maximum of work be got
out of Somális.</p>

<p>I am against taking servants from India. They require a great
deal of water, and are at enmity with their surroundings in a country
where there are practically no villages nor bazaars, and where they are
almost “put to Coventry” by the natives. Somális think them
effeminate, saying they may be men in the town, but that they become
women in the bush, especially in the waterless Haud! In our Dolbahanta
journey the women ran after my Madras cook, who was dressed
in flowing white with a large turban, and asked him whose wife he was!
Sometimes when my brother was out of camp, the Somáli members of
the expedition used to throw stones at his Punjabi “bearer,” and although
a fine fellow in his own country, among the strange surroundings he
used to break down, and with many tears ask to be sent to the coast.
One day, when aggravated beyond all endurance by the Somális, he
shouldered his bundle of brass cooking-pots and started, without food
or water, to walk across a hundred miles of pathless Haud. Luckily
he was tracked up and brought back into camp. It is not necessary
to take Indians; for Somális, though often rather rough as servants in
a civilised household, pick up their duties quickly, and are good enough
for the jungle.</p>

<p>In fitting out a caravan, the chief factors governing the calculation
are:—</p>

<p>(1) What is the minimum number of armed men that should be
taken into the district to be visited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>(2) Whether or not the district is waterless.</p>

<p>(3) The duration of the trip.</p>

<p>As regards the first consideration, I will mention different districts,
and state what escort I should take into each, assuming political conditions
to be as favourable as they were in 1893. Local disturbances
of course arise, but on the whole the country is becoming safer every
year for Europeans. My estimate may soon be out of date; and the
political authorities in Aden, who are in touch with events in Somáliland,
must be consulted as to the strength of the escort. Permission must
be obtained from the same authorities to enter Northern Somáliland
at all.</p>

<p>At ordinary times I would ride about alone, though of course armed,
within the area contained by lines joining Berbera, Wagar, Hargeisa,
and Elmas Mountain; and in this area the natives may often be seen
unarmed. As a matter of fact a sportsman would always have a few
Somális in attendance, either armed with his spare sporting rifles or
with their own spears. An European who went unarmed about the
country would excite the universal derision of the natives, for it is their
own fashion to go armed.</p>

<p>Outside this area, in the explored parts of the British Protectorate,
I think from eight to fifteen rifles should be distributed among the
followers; and on the Abyssinian border, or in the Gadabursi and
Dolbahanta countries, fifteen to twenty rifles. In distant Ogádén, on
the Webbe Shabéleh, and on the western Gálla border, I recommend
from twenty to thirty rifles, and the same in the unexplored country along
the coast east of Karam. For the nearer Gálla tribes south of the
Webbe, and for the Aulihán Somális, I should take from thirty to fifty
rifles. For a distant exploration into the far interior of Gállaland, likely
to be inhabited by hostile natives, were I going on such an expedition,
I would not take less than from fifty to one hundred and fifty rifles.
These estimates are necessarily very rough, for so much depends on
the number of camels to be protected and the number of white men;
and in the last case I have given my opinion on evidence obtained from
the Somális, and not with any personal experience of the Gálla country
itself. The strongest escort I have had at any time in my Somáli trips
has been about thirty rifles.</p>

<p>The object of these escorts in all but the last case is to guard
against a possible raid by some robber band. Once, to my knowledge,
in the Jibril Abokr country, an English sportsman’s camp was, during
his absence, sacked by some of these rascals. At night, too, the caravan
of an European might easily be mistaken for that of Somáli traders,
and in case of an attack it would be awkward, not to say undignified,
for the caravan to be incapable of defence. It is very unlikely that the
authorities at Aden would allow any traveller to go into the interior
without his having made some provision of this sort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>Hostility from any Somáli tribes, as a whole, has not entered into
my calculations, because only a large escort, such as I have advised for
distant Gálla explorations, could stay in the country in the face of a
combined movement of the natives. Even with a large escort the
country would soon be rendered uninhabitable by tampering with
wells and other expedients which Somális thoroughly understand, and
the traveller would be forced to retreat, or advance so rapidly to a more
friendly tribe that enemies would have no time to collect. It is with
the consent of the natives that we travel, because the English are
popular, and no hostility need be feared except the very unlikely
chance of an attack by robbers, made probably by mistake. No
robbers armed only with spears would, as a general rule, knowingly
attack the well-armed caravan of an European. There have, however,
been one or two exceptions. The country is only really dangerous to
a native traveller, and that it is so the daily police records at Berbera
will show.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Example I</span></h3>

<p>We will first suppose that a single European proposes to spend
six weeks travelling, purely for sport, in the explored parts of the
British Protectorate, political conditions being favourable. We will
assume that he does not wish to extend his wanderings far into the
Haud waterless plateau. The above trip would be suitable for a sportsman
from Aden having very limited leave, as those from London or
Bombay would probably go farther and try unexplored ground.</p>

<p>The minimum number of personal servants will be as follows:—</p>

<p>One body servant to look after the tent and bedding, and lay out
the meals. He should also be able to interpret.</p>

<p>One cook.</p>

<p>Two hunters (called, in Hindustáni, <i>shikáris</i>) to track, collect news
of game, carry spare rifles, clean them, and skin and prepare specimens.</p>

<p>One personal camelman to lead, saddle, unsaddle, and tend the
Somáli camel which will be ridden, at a walking pace, by the European
traveller; this camel would be led by the camelman. Somáli camels
do not trot. I have found this method of progression, though slow,
irksome, and rather uncomfortable, to be very practical. Whenever
game is sighted it is possible to jump off for a shot, or to fire from the
camel’s back. Spare rifles, ammunition, blankets, and food can be
carried, which would be impossible where a pony is ridden. A pony
requires water in the Haud, whereas a Somáli camel does not. In
long expeditions, where expensive arrangements are made on a large
scale, it may answer to take a good Arab trotting camel from Aden.
These camels, though excellent in every way, require daily grain, and
water at least every second day; while Somáli camels, though incapable
of trotting, have the advantage of picking up their own food by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the wayside, and can, at a pinch, march without water for nearly a
fortnight. If it is, however, decided to take ponies, they can be
obtained nearly anywhere in Somáliland.</p>

<p>For this led camel mats will not do. An Arab pad saddle must be
bought in Aden, and as it is sometimes difficult to procure, it might
with advantage be ordered beforehand.</p>

<p>The following articles may be carried on the led camel which is
ridden by the European:—</p>

<p>A pair of saddle-bags.</p>

<p>Haversacks containing food and spare ammunition.</p>

<p>Small hand camera.</p>

<p>A couple of spare sporting rifles.</p>

<p>Two or three blankets.</p>

<p>Large water-bottle.</p>

<p>Prismatic compass (if used).</p>

<p>It is the duty of the attendant, whom I have called the personal
camelman, to see that these things are correctly packed on the camel
at the beginning of a march, and safely housed in the tent on camp
being pitched.</p>

<p>Thus, as above shown, we have five personal servants. The
remaining servants will be camelmen for the baggage camels, and
temporary servants who may be engaged for short periods in the
interior, such as guides.</p>

<p>Some of the camelmen should know something of the line of
proposed travel, and be able to act as guides if local guides fail.</p>

<p>Over all, whether personal servants or camelmen, should be placed
a headman or caravan commander, who will also be interpreter and
confidential adviser to his European master. He should know whichever
of the three languages—Arabic, Hindustáni, or English—his master
wishes to make the medium between himself and the natives. His
business is to superintend the loading of the camels, select the site for
the halting-place, and superintend the pitching of the new camp; to
interview chiefs and natives who visit the camp, to have military
command of the caravan in the absence of his master, to arrange
for the relief of sentries at night, and choose the place for the zeríba
and the watch-fires.</p>

<p>Assisted by one of the camelmen, who will have extra pay for the
purpose, he should weigh out the daily rations, and be responsible for all
native food, and for any game meat handed over to him by the
hunters. In fact he is responsible to his master for everything that
goes on in the caravan.</p>

<p>On this man the success of the expedition, of course, chiefly
depends. Having once chosen my headman, I allow him to suit
himself as regards engaging camelmen, insisting that they shall not all
belong to one tribe. I always choose my personal servants myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to calculate roughly the number of baggage camels and
camelmen required, it will be necessary to first estimate the number of
camel-loads that would have to be carried if the rations and spare
ammunition of the camelmen were left out. That is, we must first
ascertain the number of camel-loads which would be a constant
quantity in the calculation.</p>

<p>Whatever the number of baggage camels and camelmen may be,
the European, the headman, and the five personal servants are a
constant quantity. Three natives engaged locally in the interior may
be added to this number, so without counting the baggage camelmen
we have one European and nine Somális to provide rations for.</p>

<p>Thus we have the following camel-loads, namely,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) 42 days’ rations for 1 European.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) 42 days’ rations for 9 Somális (with percentage for guests).</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Baggage of the European.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Sporting ammunition, spare ammunition for 9 Somális, and extras.</p>

<p>We will add up these items. Let A be the resulting number of
camel-loads.</p>

<p>By a simple calculation we can now tell how many baggage camels
and camelmen we shall want.</p>

<p>The custom is for one camelman to look after two camels.</p>

<p>A camelman’s rations (with percentage for guests) for 42 days will
be—</p>

<table summary="Rations for a camelman for 42 days">
  <tr>
    <td>Rice</td>
    <td class="tdr">49</td>
    <td>lbs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Dates</td>
    <td class="tdr">26</td>

    <td class="tdr total">89</td>
    <td class="total">lbs.,</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class="noindent">or a third of a camel-load.</p>

<p>Thus, as one camelman looks after two camels, the weight due to
his rations and ammunition will put one-sixth of a camel-load upon
each of them; and so to carry five of the loads A we shall want six
camels. Hence divide the number A by five and multiply by six, and
we shall have the number of camels we must purchase for the caravan,
and the number of camelmen we must engage to look after them will
be half this.</p>

<p>I consider 275 lbs. a fair load of European baggage for a Somáli
camel, not counting the weight of the camel-mats. All compact
weights, such as dates, are difficult to carry, and 260 lbs. is a full load;
while loads distributed over plenty of surface, such as rice <i>loghs</i> or water
in several <i>háns</i>, are easily carried, and so in such cases the loads may
go up to 340 lbs.</p>

<p>If we allow 1½ camel-loads for 42 days’ rations for one European,
and 2½ for his baggage (including tent, cooking-pots, spare rifles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
ammunition, and so forth), 1 camel for cloth and extras, and 3 for
Somáli rations, then A stands for 8, and our caravan will require
by our rough calculation ten baggage camels and five camelmen.</p>

<p>One of these camelmen will be given a slight increase of pay, and
be made <i>makadam</i> in charge of the camels and camelmen, under the
headman of the caravan.</p>

<p>The duties of the camelmen will be to load and unload the camels,
lead them when on the march, keep guard over them when grazing,
and water them when necessary.</p>

<p>In addition to the special duties of camelmen, servants, and hunters,
every Somáli member of the expedition, including the headman, should
take his share of the following duties which are necessary for the
common comfort, namely,—</p>

<p>To carry a rifle or spear and aid in defence if necessary.</p>

<p>Sentry duties in camp.</p>

<p>Collecting firewood for the watch-fires.</p>

<p>Water-supply for camp use.</p>

<p>Forming the zeríba round the camp.</p>

<p>If every Somáli, without exception, is made to take his share in these
duties there will be no jealousy or trouble connected with them. The
European, to whom the climate is strange, should be the only man
exempt from such duty; but when away from camp, with only two
or three attendants, I was accustomed to take my share.</p>

<p>There being such a small force, it will pay to arm the eleven men
with good weapons, such as Martini or Snider carbines, or Remingtons.
I have also generally given or lent my men the following equipment,
namely, one “kháki” drill coat, with pockets; one cartridge
belt and pouch to contain an oiled rag, one brown blanket, and one
cheap butcher’s knife in leather sheath. This equipment is not
absolutely necessary, but it is desirable if the escort is to be smart and
efficient. The cartridge belt would be made to contain thirty cartridges,
of which a few would be loaded with buckshot for sentry-duty at night.
It is necessary to be careful that men who may accompany their
master when shooting have no white about their clothing, as it drives
away game.</p>

<p>The headman, five personal servants, and five camelmen, eleven
in all, will be the permanent party engaged beforehand, who will serve
throughout the trip and return with the caravan to the coast. In
addition, enough food should be carried for the following temporary
servants, to be engaged locally in the interior and dismissed again as
required, namely,—</p>

<p>Two guides, one being for the white man, to accompany him and
the two hunters when out shooting; the other, who may with advantage
be an influential <i>Akil</i>,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> to guide the camel caravan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>One small boy, to look after milk goats, sheep, or donkeys, which
it may be necessary to buy in the interior and drive along with the
caravan. Donkeys are useful as baits for lions.</p>

<p>We shall require to buy twelve camels, ten being for baggage, one
being for the European to ride, one being a spare camel without
mats or load. About 10 per cent is a good proportion of spare
camels. They are not absolutely necessary, but desirable.</p>

<p>We will now accurately calculate what will be the loads, and
whether the ten baggage camels will be able to carry them.</p>

<p>The loads will come under the following heads:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Rations, 42 days, for 14 Somális (with percentage for guests).</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Rations, 42 days, for one European.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Private baggage, tent, and instruments of European.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Spare ammunition for escort, and spare sporting ammunition.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Cloth for payments in the interior, a large cooking-pot for the
men, and miscellaneous extras.</p>

<p>Although it is advisable to allow for a day’s water being carried
on any Somáli expedition, we will neglect water-supply in the present
calculation. It is fully gone into in Example II.</p>

<p>The rations for a caravan follower are 1 lb. rice, ½ lb. dates, and
2 oz. ghee (clarified butter) per man per diem.</p>

<p>The dates are sold at Aden and Berbera, compressed into a
solid mass. They are very good eating even for an European, when
they are fairly fresh, and they keep in good condition for a few
months.</p>

<p>The ghee is required for mixing with the daily allowance of boiled
rice. In the early days of our Protectorate the ghee ration was fixed
for Government followers at 1 oz., but as nearly all the complaints
and caravan troubles were traced to insufficiency of ghee, my brother
and I always gave 2 oz. in our later expeditions, and then everything
went smoothly. We found that the extra ounce made all the
difference between a set of intriguing rascals and a cheerful, contented
caravan.</p>

<p>It will be found in practice that the ghee disappears most quickly,
being the most popular part of the ration; the dates come next, and the
rice last. Dates often come in very handy when a native has to be sent
on a two or three days’ errand through the bush. Half a dozen pounds
of dates tied up in the free end of his tobe, with a well here and there
and the shelter of a bush, will be all the board and lodging he will
require for nearly a week’s outing.</p>

<p>It has been my custom to take into the interior a spring-balance
or steelyard reading to about 90 lbs., and every fortnight to check
the consumption of rice, dates, and ghee in bulk. A gallon measure
and a pair of small scales should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>Daily at the camps several natives will appear at about meal-time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
as self-constituted guests. To such it should be explained politely, but
firmly, that there is water in the well and grass upon the plain, but no
food in camp for loafers. No work, no food, should be the rule. A
present of a pinch of tobacco will then turn the applicant into a friend
for life.</p>

<p>It is desirable to set aside a proportion, however, for necessary
guests, and after calculating the rations for the members of the expedition
I usually add the following:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Rice, ⅙</li>
<li>Dates, ¼</li>
<li>Ghee, ½</li>
</ul>

<p>The rice ration for 14 Somális for 42 days will be 588 lbs.; add ⅙
for guests, and we have 686 lbs. Rice is sold in bags containing each
about 170 lbs.; and before starting on a trip each bag should, for convenience
of loading, be broken up into three long sausage-shaped bags,
called <i>loghs</i>. Two bags of rice, or six <i>loghs</i>, make a camel-load.</p>

<p>Thus we have, rice, 2 camel-loads. The dates ration for 14
Somális for 42 days will be 294 lbs.; add ¼ for guests, and we have
368 lbs.</p>

<p>Dates are sold by the <i>gosra</i>, weighing about 130 lbs., enclosed in a
rough reed basket or bag. For convenience of transport this is divided
into two parts, and two <i>gosras</i>, or four half <i>gosras</i>, go upon one camel.</p>

<p>Thus we have, dates, 1½ camel-loads.</p>

<p>The ghee ration for 14 Somalis for 42 days will be 1176 oz.; add
for guests, and we have 1764 oz., or 110 lbs. The ghee is sold by
the <i>gumba</i>, a goatskin bag closed at the mouth by a framework of sticks
and a lump of clay. Each <i>gumba</i> contains 25 lbs. ghee or less. We
will suppose the 110 lbs. ghee is carried in five <i>gumbas</i>, weighing with
their contents 145 lbs. Thus we have, ghee, ½ camel-load.</p>

<p>It tends to cheerfulness if a small supply of native coffee, tobacco,
and salt be carried for the men. The tobacco is chewed, and the
coffee is drunk before early marches on cold mornings. These extras
weigh very little.</p>

<p>Next we have to calculate for the stores of one European for 42
days. I recommend that several wooden boxes be made, measuring
about 1 foot 6 inches by 2 feet 3 inches, and 1 foot 3 inches deep,
capable of being padlocked, with the cover on hinges, and two rope
handles for convenience of handling. All the liquids which have to
be kept in bottles may go in one box, and all the tinned and other
stores in another, the pair containing a fortnight’s supply, and each
loading up to about 65 lbs.</p>

<p>The liquids will be something like the following (a fortnight’s
supply):—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Other articles, which could be stored in bottles, would suggest themselves—</p>

<p>The stores will be something like the following (for one fortnight):—</p>

<li>Cocoa</li>
<li>Sardines</li>

<li>Powdered alum<a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> (for preparing skins)</li>
<li>Tinned fruits</li>
</ul>

<p>Of Swiss milk very little need be taken, as milk goats can be bought
and driven along with the caravan.</p>

<p>Soups are most useful, and I usually take about ten tins for a fortnight.</p>

<p>Fresh potatoes can be bought in Aden, and will last for the first
three weeks of the trip. They would go in a separate sack. Onions
may be taken in the same way.</p>

<p>Biscuits and small tins of potted meats, provided salt kinds such
as anchovy and bloaters are omitted, are useful to carry in the pocket
when out for a day’s hunting. The salt kinds are of course objectionable,
as they induce thirst. I seldom carried any large tins of meat.
Dried game meat can always be saved, to be used in case of emergency.</p>

<p>I only used lamp oil for two bull’s-eye lanterns which I kept for
theodolite work. They make good night referring points if fixed
half a mile away. I had candle lanterns for camp use, and spring
candlesticks with glass globes for the tent.</p>

<p>Four of these boxes, containing stores or liquors, will go on one
camel.</p>

<p>Thus we have, European rations and stores for 42 days, 1½ camel-loads.
For private baggage, tent, instruments, cooking-pots, and bedding,
allow 2 camel-loads. For cloth, large cooking-pot for the men,
bags of spare ammunition for sporting rifles, and extras, we will allow 1
camel-load. The men will carry thirty rounds each in their cartridge
belts or pouches, and for such a short trip it will not be necessary to
have more than fifty rounds per man carried in one box. A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
buckshot and blank ammunition would also be carried, the latter being
useful for drill and firing salutes.</p>

<p>Sporting ammunition should be carried in haversacks or magazines
distributed about the loads, each rifle having its own bag of ammunition;
and a little should be carried in a couple of haversacks on the riding
camel, ready to hand. The sporting cartridges for the day’s use would
be carried in the pockets of the sportsman and his two hunters. If
one large box of spare sporting ammunition and one box of Snider ball
ammunition be also carried, we must allow—spare ammunition, ½
camel-load.</p>

<p>The camel-loads for the ten baggage camels will be as follows:—</p>

<p>The expenses of such a trip may be conveniently grouped as
follows:—</p>

<p>(<i>1</i>) Purchase of tent, rifles, and kit of all sorts in London or
Bombay.</p>

<p>(<i>2</i>) Passages to and from Aden.</p>

<p>(<i>3</i>) Hotel expenses in Aden.</p>

<p>(<i>4</i>) Purchase of necessaries at Aden.</p>

<p>(<i>5</i>) Passages from Aden to the Somáli coast and back.</p>

<p>(<i>6</i>) Purchase and sale of necessaries at the coast.</p>

<p>(<i>7</i>) Purchase and sale of camels at the coast.</p>

<p>(<i>8</i>) Petty expenses in the interior.</p>

<p>(<i>9</i>) Pay of men of the caravan.</p>

<p>Only in the case of the last four items—that is, the sums which will
be actually spent in Somáliland itself—can I give estimates; but it is
just in these items the local knowledge is so valuable.</p>

<p>The currency used at Aden and the Somáli coast ports is silver,
usually rupees, or dollars (worth 2⅛ rupees); and the rupee is
constant as regards purchasing power. The value of a rupee in
English money can be found daily in the newspapers. When I
was last at Aden a sovereign was worth about 16 rupees.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Purchase of Tent, Rifles, and other Kit</span></h4>

<p>I recommend a double fly 80 lb. “Cabul” tent. Somális, who take
shelter from rain under camel-mats, do not require a tent. I consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
that in a comparatively dry country like Somáliland camp furniture is
superfluous. My tent arrangements are very simple. Between the two
tent poles five of the wooden store-boxes are placed side by side. One
set of soft camel-mats (the Somáli substitute for a packsaddle) is
spread over the boxes, and my blankets and pillow go over all. When
marching fast I never pitch the tent at all, and in this case all the
boxes are piled to windward, to form a rampart about five feet high.
Camel-mats are thrown over for a roof, and the bed is spread out on
the ground beneath. The mats may be thrown off when it is not
raining, as in fine weather I prefer to have nothing to shut out the
sky. This arrangement gives less trouble to the men, who may be
tired after a long march, than pitching the tent; and it is much easier
to load up for the early morning march. By day, when marching
fast, I halt for three hours about noon, without pitching the tent, if
two good trees are to be found.</p>

<p>When the tent is pitched the bed is arranged on the store-boxes,
taking care that those which contain “expense stores” are not so used,
as it is annoying if the cook is constantly disturbing the bedding to
open boxes. Against one pole rests a jar of water, which is constantly
kept cool by the wind blowing upon the porous earthenware. This
jar is carried on the camels in a framework of sticks. It can be
bought in Berbera for half a rupee, and the butler can be rewarded
with two rupees if it is brought back to the coast unbroken. The iron
tent-pegs<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> should similarly be handed to the same official, and, say, two
annas given for every peg which finds its way back to the coast. The
Somális, though not naturally petty thieves, cannot resist iron tent-pegs;
they are easily secreted, and disposed of to jungle natives, who
make spears with the iron. All cutlery if not looked after is apt to
disappear in the same way. At the back of my tent I usually stood a
large bucket of water and waterproof sheet, or an india-rubber bath.
Table and chairs I seldom took. In case of meeting Europeans, a
very fine substitute for a dining-table and chairs can be arranged by
the help of the store-boxes, draped with different coloured blankets.</p>

<p>The first thing after the tent has been pitched, two <i>auss</i>, or smooth
grass camel-mats, are laid down as a substitute for floorcloth. To the
right of the bed, on the ground, are laid all small articles which may
be required at a moment’s notice, including the favourite rifle and
cartridge belt. At night this rifle is kept loaded, and a strip of white
paper is gummed along the central rib from the back-sight to the
muzzle. When a leopard jumps into the middle of the camp, or there
is a “war-scare,” one or other of which incidents occurs on an average
once a week in Somáliland, it is convenient not to have to waste
valuable seconds in fumbling for these things in the dark. On the
ground, to the left of the bed, are arranged haversacks, small camera,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
spare rifles, medicine bag, instruments, a pair of saddle-bags, and other
such articles; and to the right of the pillow is placed one store-box, and
on it a candle lantern, matches, and the favourite book, which is an
absolute necessity for camp life. For the spare clothing, books, spare
instruments, stationery, and other articles, I recommend strong tin
uniform cases, or steel trunks, instead of leather trunks, because they
can be left out in the rain without damage. Leather trunks are soon
pulled out of shape by the loading ropes, and are liable to be utterly
ruined by white ants in a single night. The tin cases may be painted
white with ship’s paint; when painted black they absorb the sun’s rays
and bake everything inside. Photograph plates and other very perishable
articles should be carefully packed to avoid damage from excessive
heat, the sun’s rays being so powerful; for instance, at noon in
Guban a rifle barrel, if left lying exposed, very soon becomes too hot
to touch.</p>

<p>The sporting battery which I should take were I now fitting out
an expedition, would be—</p>

<p>One double .577 Express rifle (with 250 cartridges for six weeks).</p>

<p>One double 8-bore Paradox ball gun (with 150 ball cartridges and
a few buckshot).</p>

<p>One double 12-bore Paradox ball gun (with 100 ball, 200
shot).</p>

<p>One single Lee-Metford .303 rifle (with 300 rounds).</p>

<p>The cartridges would be filled and soldered up in tin in convenient
quantities by the gunmaker who sold the rifles. I have never taken
the trouble to load rifle cartridges; a good maker will load them well,
and if soldered up they will keep for years. I believe most of the
letting off and wounding of game is due more to the inability to get
close enough than to defects in rifle or cartridges. For the open
plains, when the game is shy, the Lee-Metford will be very useful.
The grass is often so short that shots may be taken on the back
position. Every shot knocks up a puff of dust, enabling one to correct
one’s aim. In the case of an antelope the neck should be aimed at,
so that the animal will be missed or killed; and a very deadly shot is
obtained when the animal is standing head on, so as to present the
length of the body to a raking bullet. If the distance be very great,
the animal will, if unwounded, stand for several shots. In this way,
managed with science, long shots are not unsportsmanlike, and I must
confess to a feeling of pleasure when an almost black bull hartebeest,
whose horns have been admired at leisure through the telescope, and
who has been standing four hundred yards away thinking himself out
of range, drops stone dead as if struck by lightning after a few unsuccessful
shots. To fire at random into a herd, unless meat is urgently
required, of course is utterly indefensible.</p>

<p>In buying rifles there is a great choice of good makers. Personally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
I have nearly always gone to Messrs. Holland and Holland for my
rifles and ammunition, and have been perfectly satisfied with the way
in which I have been treated. Their eight-bore Paradox ball gun I
consider the best weapon in the market for heavy game such as
elephant or rhino. I had a four-bore rifle with fourteen drs. and
hard spherical ball, but found that the conical steel-core projectile of
the eight-bore gave greater shock and penetration.</p>

<p>Snider carbines are useful weapons for the escort, and it may be
noted that the ammunition makes excellent practice at short ranges when
fired out of a .577 Express. This can be done if the chamber happens
to be of the right shape, and the knowledge has been useful to me more
than once, although whether such a proceeding is good for the rifle is
questionable. A revolver or pistol is a useful weapon to carry,
especially if one wanders about in the bush alone. I recommend, if
a double <i>shikár</i> pistol be taken, that one of about .577 or twelve-bore
be chosen, with one trigger for both barrels on the Lancaster
principle. When after lion or leopard, and not well backed up by
the gunbearer, a situation may arise where such a pistol would be
handy. In a home charge the rifle would be knocked out of the
hands, but the pistol, being on the belt, would always be ready. I
have known two cases of a native trying to beat off a lion with his
bare hands. One man was successful and the other lost his life. I
feel sure that in the latter case a good pistol would have made all
the difference. It is worth remembering that when buying a Lee-Metford
rifle of military pattern, the bayonet should be supplied with it,
as it is a perfect <i>shikár</i> knife for the belt.</p>

<p>In disturbed country, where an attack by robbers may be apprehended,
the eight-bore Paradox gun loaded with S.S.G. slugs would
be a good night weapon to rely upon. I therefore recommend that
a few cartridges be so loaded for this and the twelve-bore. Among
the .577 Express bullets should be about 10 per cent of hardened
solid bullets. They may be very useful in finishing off heavy game.</p>

<p>When after thick-skinned game, such as elephant or rhino, I think
the Lee-Metford would be a useful rifle, provided a quiet head shot
could be obtained with the animal standing still, both barrels of the
double eight-bore being kept in reserve for use if it should get into
motion. Although I have always believed in large-bore rifles, I think
there is a great future in store for the very small bores of the Lee-Metford
class, having a long bullet and plenty of powder. Although
the section is so small, the great remaining velocity of the Lee-Metford
bullet causes a considerable shock to the animal, especially if the latter
has been standing end on, and the bullet has raked forward for some
distance. I consider the Lee-Metford about the best rifle for oryx-shooting
in uninhabited country, and have in my latter trips had great
success with it. I used the ordinary military cartridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>With each of the sporting rifles there should be a good strong
magazine bag, which can be slung over any of the laden camels. Half
the spare ammunition would be carried in this way, while the rest of
the spare ammunition for all the sporting battery would be packed in
one box, weighing about 50 lbs. Several leather or canvas haversacks
should be made to carry food and small articles.</p>

<p>For the Snider carbines I recommend that for a six weeks’ trip
thirty rounds per man be carried in the belts, with a few rounds of
buckshot for the use of sentries; besides this belt ammunition, about
fifty rounds per man would be in a box, and some blank ammunition
for skirmishing drill and complimentary displays. If it is proposed to
give the men much ball practice while in the interior, more ball
ammunition should of course be taken. I strongly recommend an
hour of target practice once a week, in some deep river-bed with
precipitous banks, if the men are to be of any use as an escort. A
pair of compasses, a bundle of thin lathes, a dozen screws and a screwdriver,
half a quire of cartridge paper, packet of drawing pins, and some
ink pellets, are all that is required to be taken to make very good
targets. When the men have been well grounded in ball practice it
will be interesting to pile up stones to the height of a man and
bring them down with a crashing volley at a hundred yards. The
men take a lively interest in the shooting and drill, and a list should be
kept of good, bad, or indifferent shots, so that the fact may be endorsed
on their written characters when they are dismissed at the coast.</p>

<p>Some form of hand camera is invaluable, I suggest that no large
camera be used, nor chemicals, but that small photographs be taken with
the hand camera and developed and enlarged on return to England.</p>

<p>When ordering clothes it should be remembered that Somáliland
can be extremely hot and also very cold. I recommend that thin
“kháki” drill be the usual costume, and that a good thick ulster be taken
for cold night-marches or for sitting up over a “kill.” A few pairs of
red rubber or cotton-soled shoes are useful for stalking koodoo and
other game inhabiting stony ground. Above all, a really good sun hat
is a necessity.</p>

<p>Information regarding the cost of passages to and from Aden can
be obtained at any shipping offices, so I will merely remark that it takes
about three weeks to get to Aden from London by sea, or about
thirteen days if advantage be taken of the overland train to Brindisi.
But in the latter case only a small hand-bag could be taken, baggage
having previously been sent round by sea. There is generally great
trouble about the shipping of loaded cartridges, and they should be sent
on ahead.</p>

<p>When staying at an hotel in Aden I usually went to the Hotel de
L’Europe, in the Crescent, Steamer Point. The accommodation at all
the hotels in Aden is very primitive. So far as I can remember,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
board and lodging in Aden would come to between 7 and 14 rupees
per diem.</p>

<p>At Aden the following articles, if considered necessary, may be purchased
or made to order:—</p>

<p>Coats for the men, of “kháki” or drab-coloured drill (3 rupees),
cartridge belts to contain thirty rounds (1 rupee), also pouches
(½ rupee), brown blankets for followers (3 rupees). Six wooden
boxes to contain stores or liquors, as before described, can be made
in the bazaar for between 1 and 2 rupees each, or they may be
obtained in London with a fortnight’s supplies in each box. If a
camel-pad is required it can be got in Aden for 10 rupees.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>The two Parsi firms with which I have had most dealings are
Messrs. Pallonjee Dinshaw and Messrs. Cowasjee Dinshaw Bros., both of
the Crescent, Aden. The latter is probably the larger firm, and does a
great deal of business with the shipping passing through Aden. But
when I have not had time to get what I wanted from one I have tried
the other. Cowasjee is in correspondence with Mr. Mahomed Hindi,
a Hindustáni merchant permanently living in Berbera; and Pallonjee
is also accustomed to do business with the Somáli coast.</p>

<p>All information concerning passages to and from the Somáli coast
can be obtained by applying to either of the two Parsi firms named.
Two coasting steamers visit the coast ports of Berbera, Bulhár, and
Zeila once a week each. The usual charge was 20 rupees for one
European and his baggage, and 5 rupees for each native.</p>

of the selling-off auction, so that 450 rupees should well cover expenses

<p>The purchase of twelve camels will cost about 480 rupees, and their
sale at the end of the trip (allowing for one death) will produce about
330 rupees.</p>

<p>The petty expenses in the interior have been provided for by 150
rupees worth of cloth and 100 rupees in cash, already included under
the heading of expenses in Berbera. A common native engaged for a
day’s work will usually get 8 annas or the equivalent in cloth. Presents
for game bagged may be given according to taste, from 30 rupees for a
good bull elephant to 20 rupees for a lion, or 4 rupees for a bull oryx.
The present for one animal should be distributed among those who
aided in bringing it to bag, however slight their services; in fact, for a
good trophy it has been my custom to reward slightly every member
of my caravan. A sheep costs from 3 to 4 rupees; a heifer about
15 rupees; a camel, 20 to 40 rupees (either for the butcher or transport);
a pony, 60 rupees and upwards; a goat for the butcher, 1½ to 2 rupees;
a milk goat, 5 to 8 rupees; a donkey, 12 rupees. The latter animal
is a long way the best for tying up at night as a bait for lions, as the
lion likes no flesh better, and the loud bray attracts any that may be
near. A white goat, which is young enough to bleat, is the best bait
for a leopard.</p>

<p>The pay for the men of the caravan for six weeks will be approximately
as follows:<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>—</p>

<p>Of this expenditure, part will occur when starting and part when
breaking up the caravan at the close of the trip. The whole of this
money should be placed in the charge of a native merchant or banker
at Berbera, and any Somáli follower may then be paid off either at the
coast or in the interior by an order for the necessary sum, written on a
scrap of paper.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Example II</span></h3>

<p>We will assume that one European is going to travel for two
months, purely for sport, in the Haud and the most accessible parts of
Ogádén. The distance across the Haud by the usual road from
Hargeisa to Milmil is covered in five and a half days, going two marches
a day, and for all journeys going far into the Haud, or crossing to Ogádén,
arrangements should be made for carrying at least seven days’ water.
To the east of Milmil the Haud becomes much wider. From the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
experience of eight journeys across the Haud, I have found that a
gallon per man per diem for all purposes is the proper allowance for a
Somáli who is on ordinary rations, a gallon and a half for a native of
India, and two gallons for an European. Half of the water is used by
the Somáli for boiling with his rice, the other half for drinking; and it
is a thing worth knowing that if his ration is of camel meat instead of
rice, he will be perfectly satisfied with half a gallon per diem for all
purposes. For the purposes of our calculation, however, we will allow
a gallon per diem, because an eating camel is not always to be had,
and a full day’s halt is necessary to enable the men to cut up and sun-dry
the meat, causing vexatious delay. The Somáli, although he bathes at
every pool where water is to be had, does not try to wash in the Haud.
It is comforting, however, for an European or native of India to keep up
the appearance of cleanliness so far as a damp sponge and a little water
in a saucer will permit.</p>

<p>Somáli camels require no water for any march under ten days, and
can do longer at a pinch. If water is plentiful they would be watered
every five days or so. Donkeys, sheep, and goats should have a
few pints every second day, and Somáli ponies should have about two
gallons per diem, or four gallons every second day, though at a pinch
they can go, according to the natives, from three to four days without
water. Of course with an ordinary caravan this cruelty is unnecessary.</p>

<p>On one trip I took an Arab pony from India for three and a half
months. He did excellently, and was faster and up to more weight than
Somáli ponies. But he, of course, required grain and a much larger
allowance of water than a Somáli pony. I think we carried for him five
gallons per diem. If an Arab riding camel be imported from Aden, it must
be remembered that it is ordinarily accustomed to drink at least once a
day, and in the Haud must be given four gallons every second day.</p>

<p>As regards transport of water, a full load for a camel is two 12-gallon
casks; a gallon of water weighs 10 lbs., and there is the weight
of the casks to take into account.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the number of baggage camels and camelmen
required, we shall have to add up the number of camel-loads coming
under the following headings:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>The rations for 56 days for one camelman (with percentage added)
will be 66 lbs. rice, 38 lbs. dates, 10 lbs. ghee; add his spare ammunition
5 lbs., and water for 7 days 70 lbs., and we get a total of 189 lbs.,
or about ⁸/₁₁ of a camel-load.</p>

<p>By a calculation similar to that employed in Example I., we shall
find that the number of camels required will be 24, and the number of
baggage camelmen, 12.</p>

<p>The composition of our caravan will therefore be as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1 European. 1 headman. 5 personal servants.</p>

<p>(3 temporary jungle servants engaged from day to day will be
allowed for in the pay, ration, and water estimate, though
they will not start with the caravan.)</p>

<p>12 camelmen.</p>

<p>24 baggage camels; 1 Somáli camel to ride; 2 spare camels.
Total, 27 camels.</p>

</div>

<p>This is what the preliminary calculation has given us; and when
the loads have all been accurately worked out in detail it will probably
be found that the 24 baggage camels can carry them.</p>

<p>In calculating the ammunition I am assuming that every permanent
member of the caravan can shoot and will be provided with a rifle.
It is a good rule to go by, although not always absolutely necessary,
provided suitable escorts for different districts are taken.</p>

<p>To those whom I know to be unused to firearms I issue no ball
ammunition till they have had several lessons in skirmishing drill with
blank ammunition, and a certain amount of target practice. The laws
of blood-feuds are too serious to be disregarded, and therefore a
Somáli has a wholesome fear of letting off his rifle by accident. I
have found that when once they have been properly taught they can
be trusted with ball ammunition.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Example III</span></h3>

<p>A trip of four months to distant parts of Ogádén, and to the Webbe
Shabéleh river. In this case we will add a pony or mule and two
fast Arab camels, luxuries which it may be worth while taking on a
long trip.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Unlike the Somáli ones, the Arab camels each require<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
about 7 lbs. <i>jowári</i> grain per diem. It can be bought in Aden or
Berbera, and costs rather less than rice. There will in this case be six
personal servants instead of five, as the two Arab camels will require
one man, and the pony will require a groom (<i>syce</i> in Hindustáni). I
have also slightly increased the European baggage on account of
ammunition and trade goods.</p>

<p>As a basis for our rough calculation we shall have:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>In my last trip to the Webbe, occupying three months, I had 55
camels and 30 men. The trip cost me about £300 altogether.</p>

<p>The expenses can be calculated on the lines of Example I. There
will, however, be certain modifications.</p>

<p>Somális have a prejudice against going to the Webbe. They have
great fear of fever and mosquitoes; and they have a great dread of
Gállaland. They will, therefore, expect higher pay to go to these
countries. On my last trip my ordinary camelmen, who would take
15 rupees per month for trips in Guban, Ogo, Haud, and Ogádén,
would take nothing less than 18 rupees throughout the journey if we
reached the Webbe, and 20 rupees if we reached the Gálla tribes.
Circumstances have combined to place all Somáli wages at a very high
figure. The pay of an Indian body servant is in India about 10
rupees per month, but if taken to Aden, the same man requires
double pay, or 20 rupees per month. The Somáli, who is trained to
domestic service in Aden, naturally says he will not take less than the
Indian who does the same work. The Somáli at Berbera requires the
same wages which he has been accustomed to get at Aden, and similar
causes, together with intense laziness, independence, and avarice combined,
tend to raise the price of labour in Somáliland.</p>

<p>If Somális are really starving, they have only to make their way
somehow to the karias of their own tribe, and they will be kept in
board and lodging, for up country every fighting man is worth his
keep.</p>

<p>The Arab trotting camels, which I have recommended, could be
bought in Aden, including light coolie saddles (without stirrups), for
about 170 rupees each. Great care should be taken in choosing
these animals, an Arab expert who can be trusted being employed.
The attendant for these camels should be a Somáli accustomed to
them. There are many Somális who have served in the Berbera
camel police who have this qualification, but an ordinary Somáli
knows nothing about them. Besides <i>jowári</i> and water at regular
intervals, about a quart of sweet or other suitable oil per month
should be carried for each trotting camel. It is a peculiarity of these
camels that a large maggot is often found filling up the nostril, and
when it becomes so large as to impede breathing the nostril is drenched
with oil, and the maggot, sometimes half an inch thick and over an
inch long, tumbles out.</p>

<p>In a long trip, such as is given in Example III., a rapid survey of
the route would probably be made. I recommend the following
instruments:—</p>

<ul>
<li>Boiling-point thermometer and aneroid barometer.</li>
<li>Common thermometer.</li>
<li>Note-books.</li>
<li>6-inch transit theodolite.</li>
<li>Prismatic compass and stand.</li>
<li>First-class astronomical watch.</li>
<li>Two common watches.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span></p>

<p>I found the theodolite infinitely more handy than the sextant, and
think the traverse, often at the rate of twenty-five miles a day, too rapid
for comfortable plain table work. The tribesmen, too, would probably
object to the imposing plain table and strained square of paper. The
theodolite is also an imposing instrument, but it would be most used
for star observations at night, when natives would be away from camp.
Of the smaller instruments, duplicates should be taken. Instructions
on surveying are to be found in the Royal Geographical Society’s
publication, <cite>Hints to Travellers</cite>, and practical lessons in this and other
special subjects are given under the auspices of the same Society.</p>

<p>When arranging for an expedition in which water has to be carried,
12-gallon casks should be taken out to Aden, or bought beforehand in
Aden by letter. It will be advantageous to be able to padlock them,
and for the bunghole to be large enough for a man’s arm to be passed
in when cleaning the cask. I recommend common casks, for I have
taken different shapes of specially-designed water-vessels suited (in
theory) for camel transport; but Somális, who are good judges, say
camels do well with a pair of large common casks. It is worth remembering
that wooden or plaited bark water <i>háns</i>, carrying on an average
seven gallons, are always to be had at Berbera (costing about 4 rupees).
They go four to six on a camel, and being light, twenty-eight gallons
can easily be carried in one load. But owing to incessant leakage,
and to breaking, through the falling of camels and knocking against
trees, there is a very great loss of water. On the other hand, if the
casks are good, one is sure of the twenty-four gallon load, and the
supply can be accurately controlled. Casks should be filled with water
over-night and allowed to stand by the well side before a long waterless
journey, so that the wood of the casks may have time to swell. Casks
which have lost no water by morning may be trusted, and those which
have leaked should be filled again and marked, so that they may be the
first to be drawn upon on the march.</p>

<p>In one of my long trips I took forty-four water <i>háns</i>, but they caused
so much vexation through leakage and so much expense for repairs,
that I resolved never to use them again when I could get casks. They
are, however, always to be had at Berbera, if casks have been forgotten.
In buying <i>háns</i> it should be noted that drinking water for Europeans
should be carried in wooden <i>háns</i>, as they taint the water much less
than the bark ones. I recommend, for water-bottles, common quart
whisky-bottles, which can be slipped into a leather case provided with
a sling, so that it can be carried by one of the hunters. It is very convenient
to have in addition half a dozen flat water-bottles made to contain
a gallon each, of tin covered with thick leather; one of these could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
carried on the camel which is ridden. These would, of course, most
easily be made in a civilised country.</p>

<p>On the Webbe Shabéleh a little <i>jowári</i> grain can generally be
purchased at the villages, though the natives, I believe, only grow it for
home consumption and not for export. I would never count on getting
either <i>jowári</i> or ghee in the interior, as every purchase of this kind
means a vexatious delay, and exorbitant prices are demanded. Milk is
obtainable in abundance at every karia; and, as a special favour, if it
is asked for, the natives will produce fresh butter as good as that sold
in England when not tainted by the wooden cup of the natives. It
soon becomes sour, and it should not be counted on as a supply. I
always keep two milk goats to supply milk for my own use. Somáli
cow’s milk is generally allowed to get sour and much tainted by the
bark vessels. Good milk may be got by sending a clean bucket for it,
and having the cow milked into it.</p>

<p>Besides the tobes mentioned in the estimates for Example I., the
following are useful minor presents in Somáliland:—</p>

<p>Looking-glasses.</p>

<p>Beads. (These should be chosen by a Somáli and bought in Aden
or Berbera.)</p>

<p>Clasp knives.</p>

<p>Red shawls. (These are very much in request, and are picked to
pieces and made into tassels for saddlery ornaments. They can be
bought in Aden for ¼ rupee each.)</p>

<p>Korans or Mahomedan Bibles, which cost from 1 rupee to 3 rupees
in Aden, are good presents for mullahs.</p>

<p><i>Tusbas</i>, or praying chaplets, of ebony or sandalwood, ½ rupee to 1
rupee, procurable in Aden.</p>

<p>Files for sharpening spears.</p>

<p>Coloured handkerchiefs.</p>

<p>Red blankets or coloured plaids. (These and common brown
blankets make good presents for important natives, and are always useful
to have about the tent.)</p>

<p>In choosing presents it must be remembered that Somális, being
very sensible people, will not be burdened in their nomad life with
unnecessary articles, and will not be satisfied with glittering but useless
things which might pass among negroes. Each present must be really
good and useful. A Somáli will examine a gift blanket very critically.</p>

<p>Presents and trade articles for Gállaland can be got in Aden, and
should be chosen by a Somáli or Gálla expert, who knows something of
the districts to be visited. <i>Wiláyati</i> (European) cotton cloth, something
similar to <i>Merikáni</i> (American), but narrower and half the price,
is there the most useful kind.</p>

<p>If it is intended to cross the Webbe, a rope (say 2 to 3 inches in circumference
and 60 fathoms long) should be taken to be stretched across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
the river. At Karanleh the river is some 90 yards wide, except in
flood time. When this rope has been stretched across the river, the
native rafts can be attached to it by running loops made of bruised
creeper, and the rafts pulled to and fro hand over hand. The rope
enables a caravan to cross in one day, whereas without it the passage
might occupy seven days. Such a rope is easily obtainable in Aden,
and weighs 40 to 60 lbs.</p>

<p>On very important and distant expeditions it may be worth while
to take a folding boat, in order to be independent of the avaricious
river negroes, who will strike for higher wages if they think you depend
on their help.</p>

<p>When fitting out an expedition which may in the course of the
journey have to change to mule or human transport, as would
occur at Harar or in parts of Gállaland, it may be worth considering
whether the loads should not be capable of subdivision. Thus
the boxes I have recommended for holding European stores, if not
very full and made a little lower, would weigh about 55 lbs. Four of
these would conveniently go on a camel, two on a mule, one on a man.</p>

<p>I have said that “no work, no pay” should be the rule for jungle
tribesmen, but in the wilder parts of Somáliland it has hitherto been the
custom for passing caravans to make small presents to the heads of clans
for the privilege of going through the country. This payment is something
similar to the Masai <i>hongo</i>. The usual etiquette is for a dozen
horsemen or so to arrive from a distance and perform equestrian games
(<i>dibáltig</i>); afterwards the performers and one or two elders are given
presents, and then the caravan is free to go on its way. In the territory
of tribes which I know I make the present very small, say one red
shawl and half a tobe to each horseman, and I give a display with
blank cartridge with the men formed up in skirmishing order, as a
return compliment, which is always highly appreciated.</p>

<p>In expeditions to Ogádén and Gállaland I recommend that Sheikh
Mattar of Hargeisa, if met with on the way, be asked to write Arabic
letters of introduction to Mahomedan sheikhs and mullahs. He is
widely known, and has often helped me in this way. He has also
assisted me by taking care of loads which I have had, on occasions, to
leave temporarily at Hargeisa.</p>

<p>Sometimes it may be worth while to hire extra camels (at 1 rupee
per diem for a camel and ½ rupee for a man) for the first few days of
a journey. In my calculation I make no allowance for trophies, because
of course as a trip goes on the food-loads lighten.</p>

<p>As regards arrangements for the security of a caravan, I consider
that unless the escort is well in hand and thoroughly up to its duties it
will be worse than useless when an emergency arises. I do not believe
in engaging a certain proportion of the men for the special purpose of
forming the escort. If so engaged they will refuse to do all other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
work, and will give themselves airs over the camelmen and servants.
I have tried the system, and found it lead to jealousy and the shirking
of duties.</p>

<p>In most of my expeditions I have engaged my men as headman,
camelmen, servants, and guides, having first explained that every
Somáli of the caravan will take his share in the common defence.
When I have been making up my caravans I have first calculated the
number of servants I require, and have engaged them myself satisfying
myself on the spot that each either understands the use of a rifle or
is capable of soon learning it. The headman has been present, so
that if he has any personal objection to any of the men he may state it.
I have then told the headman to bring up for engagement the number
of camelmen I require, allowing him to choose his own friends; and if
I find that any of these are unfit to be trusted with firearms I discard
them, and tell the headman to bring others in their place. To each
man I explain the special duties he is engaged for, and the duties which
he will share with all the members of the caravan, and ask if he is
satisfied. When the men have all been engaged at the coast I appoint
a time of parade and a convenient spot on the shore, and each man
fires two or three rounds of ball ammunition at a mark, under my
superintendence. The ball ammunition should be brought to the spot
in a bag, not served out to the men. In fact I seldom serve out any
ball ammunition till the caravan has made about two marches from the
coast. If it is a large amount it may be taken out for this distance on
a hired camel.</p>

<p>After these first few shots at a mark I hold two or three parades,
serving out ten rounds of blank ammunition per man at each, and
practise the men in skirmishing.</p>

<p>The rough drill which I have always used is as follows:—</p>

<p>The men form up in line about half a pace apart, with carbines
held perpendicularly in the right hand and close to the side (the
carbine “shoulder”).</p>

<p>On the word “Advance” all run forward steadily, keeping a fairly
good line.</p>

<p>On the word “Halt” they drop to a sitting position (squatting
naturally, as natives do, on both heels).</p>

<p>“Ready”—the men load with blank cartridge.</p>

<p>“Present”—the aim is taken.</p>

<p>“Fire”—the trigger is pressed.</p>

<p>“Advance”—the men run forward again, taking care to take out
any unexploded cartridge or to open the breech.</p>

<p>“Halt”—they sit as before, and wait for the word “Ready” or
“Advance.”</p>

<p>It might be advisable, if actually attacked when on the march, to
retire upon the camels the better to protect them; so the men should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
be practised in retiring steadily and sitting down facing the enemy to
fire, on the words “Retire” and “Halt.” The Somáli should in all
these practices be told the supposed direction of the enemy, and also
that whenever he is given the word “Halt” he is to squat down facing
the enemy. I always carry a good whistle; and when the men are
advancing, retiring, or halted ready for firing volleys, I sound an alarm
on the whistle, and train the men to run to me and form a rough
double circle round me, outer circle squatting on their heels, inner
circle standing. We then fire volleys, the idea being that the enemy
is trying to overwhelm the escort by a rush to close quarters.</p>

<p>On the word “Advance” the men run out in a rough line facing the
enemy. It is wonderful how quickly Somalis get to understand the
few English words of command which are necessary, and how well they
grasp the idea in each movement. This is because they are brought
up from childhood among raids and skirmishes.</p>

<p>The headman, if he is any good, will soon learn to command the
men at drill, and he should be often practised in this. The men take
the greatest delight in these drills, especially if plenty of blank cartridge
is given them, and when it is desirable to gain the firm friendship of a
tribe and at the same time to impress the tribesmen with the efficiency
of the escort, there is nothing like giving a display of this kind.</p>

<p>During the first few days’ march from the coast, when in uninhabited
country, I accustom the men to run out quickly to defend the
line of camels. Moving out to the front, flank, or rear, I blow the
alarm whistle, and the men run out and sit down in line, facing the
supposed enemy. A few of the worst shots should be told off permanently,
their duty being to stay among the camels and guard and
look after them, so that the bulk of the men will be free to attack the
enemy. This duty of holding camels in an emergency is not popular,
and this will be an incentive to the men to try and shine at the target
practices.</p>

<p>The natural habit of Somális when marching with a caravan is for
the two or three camelmen who are required to lead the strings of
camels to be with them, while the bulk of the men either lead the way
or lag behind with the last camel. The camel <i>makadam</i> should be
among these, and whenever a camel falls or shifts its load it is Somáli
etiquette for every man near to run up to its assistance. It is not
generally necessary, therefore, except in very disturbed country, to tell
off a rear-guard, and I do not believe in constantly worrying tired men
with theories when things are practically going on well.</p>

<p>In very disturbed country it is advisable to make only one long
march in the morning, and to devote the afternoon to fortifying the
camp with a good zeríba. While it is still daylight every man should
be shown his place in case of a night alarm, and at dusk, having first
given notice to the men, the alarm whistle should be blown, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
should jump to their places and then be dispersed. When night falls
it is the duty of the headman to see the watch-fires lit and to post the
sentry or sentries required. The fires should be outside the zeríba, and
screened by it, or by a bush, from the eyes of the sentry. If the glare
of the fire is in his face he will not be able to see out into the
darkness.</p>

<p>The relief of sentries, and all arrangements connected with them,
are best left to the headman. I found that Somális, once posted, as a
rule make very faithful and reliable sentries. The usual challenge is,
“<i>War kumá?</i>” (Who’s there?)</p>

<p>By day it is not usually necessary to keep a sentry, but there are
two occasions when Somális are particularly off their guard. First, at
about 8 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, if they are grouped together eating camel meat and
shouting to one another, so that nothing else can be heard; secondly,
between 1 and 2 <span class="smcapuc">P.M.</span>, when they are generally all asleep, scattered
under the shade of different trees outside the camp. If I had the
conduct of an attack on Somális, I would choose one of these occasions
for effecting a surprise.</p>

<p>The zeríba can be arranged in many ways, the principle being that
it should be low enough to fire over and wide enough to prevent a
rush. The zeríba of the Somáli nomads, which is often twelve feet
high, shuts out all view of the outside ground, and is only a trap for
men armed with rifles. From four to five feet high and twelve feet
wide is a good zeríba. The great difficulty is where to place the camels,
and Somális are prejudiced in favour of a circular zeríba with the camels
occupying the centre, which would not, I should say, be the European way.
When the camels are out grazing, or a few are sent with empty casks to
a distant well, enough men with firearms should be with them to defend
them, if necessary, and one man should be placed in command.</p>

<p>It often occurs in bush country that men lose themselves, and
guiding shots are required, especially at night. The men should have
blank ammunition for this purpose, and should be fined for every ball
cartridge wasted in this way or fired indiscriminately at game. Firing
at game by men of the caravan, except under special circumstances,
should be strictly prohibited, as it causes danger to any natives or live
stock that may be about in the bush, and may land the traveller in a
troublesome blood-feud. Men who are paid off and sent to the coast
towards the end of a trip, or who are sent down in charge of camels,
should, if they are trustworthy, be allowed to take their rifles with them,
and they should be given cheques for their back pay, arrangements having
been made so that the cheques will not be honoured till the rifles
have been safely given up. It is not fair to expect a man to go through
the territory of strange tribes without his rifle, or, at any rate, a spear
and something to show that he is the servant of an Englishman.</p>

<p>If I were organising a Somáli expedition I would begin by writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to the authorities at Aden mentioning where I wished to go, and asking
whether political conditions were favourable, whether I would be
allowed to enter the country through British ports,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and what escort I
should be required to provide myself with. I would, at the same time,
write to one of the Aden firms which I have named for information
regarding the times of sailing of coasting steamers. The securing of a
headman, on whom so much depends, may be seen to at the same
time; the most reliable quarter to go to for information on this point
would probably be friends who have already been a trip and can
nominate a man. The name of a reliable headman, who is available,
having been obtained, he should be ordered to meet the intending
traveller at Aden on a named date.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all such articles as coats, cartridge belts, store-boxes, or
Arab camel-saddle, which, if wanted at all, have to be made to order,
may be prepared by the Parsi firms. On arrival at Aden the traveller,
having already prepared a list of the number of men, camels, and
caravan kit he will require, can procure them with the help of the headman.
It may be advisable, if time is limited, for the headman to be
sent to Berbera (I am assuming Berbera as the starting-point) to buy
camels, camel-mats, axes, and other caravan kit, and have them ready
by the time his master comes out to Aden, the funds being provided
for the headman through the Aden firm acting as banker.</p>

<p>The simplest course, and one I have generally adopted, has been
to go over to Berbera, stay in camp there four or five days, and to
purchase camels and necessaries myself, with the assistance of the headman.
If, however, more than forty camels are wanted, this may involve
a delay of perhaps ten days.</p>

<p>When returning from the interior I have found it saves a good deal
of worry to stay a few days in camp in the hills, and there pay off the
bulk of the caravan with cheques on the Berbera agent. The men’s
characters would be at the same time given them, and they would be
told firmly that they need expect to get nothing more by coming up in
Berbera. The bulk of the animals and kit would be sent down with
the men, to be handed to the agent for sale by auction. Only a few
necessary camels and men need be kept at the shooting camp, and
during the two or three days’ halt the trophies can be prepared in
bundles ready for transport by steamer, small delicate specimens going
in the empty store-boxes; at the same time search-parties might be out
looking for koodoo. During the <i>Karíf</i> wind it is pleasant in the hills,
while at Berbera there are constant sand-storms, and so for half the day
nothing can be done.</p>

<p>Both for a week before and after the expedition it is advisable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
keep the headman, body servant, and cook to assist in the arrangements
at Aden and Berbera. Berbera has been named as the most convenient
port, but a start may also be made from Bulhár or Zeila; and the
camels, if a very large number be required, may perhaps with advantage
be collected simultaneously from all three places.</p>

<span class="smcap">Physical Geography</span><br />
<span class="smaller">WITH NOTES ON PRONUNCIATION AND MEANING OF NATIVE NAMES</span></h2>

<p>The Somáli country occupies the triangle known as the “Horn of Africa,”
whose eastern angle is Cape Guardafui. The coast line, beginning at
Gubbet Khrab, in the north-west, runs eastward for about six hundred
miles to Cape Guardafui, thence southward for eleven hundred miles
to Kismáyu, near the mouth of the Juba River (Webbe Ganána).</p>

<p>Starting with the north Somáli coast at our port of Berbera, the
first natural feature we come to is the sea-beach of sand and coralline
limestone, backed by the hot, semi-desert Maritime Plain, from two to
twenty miles broad, its breadth varying with the distance of the Maritime
Ranges from the coast. The plain, gradually sloping upwards from the
sea, rises to about three or four hundred feet at the base of the Maritime
mountains, and these rise about a thousand feet higher. Beyond the
Maritime mountains stony, jungle-covered, interior plains rise to the high
Gólis Range, the true plateau of the interior of Africa, which is in places
nearly six thousand nine hundred feet above sea-level. The country
from the coast line to the foot of Gólis, some thirty-five miles inland,
is called Guban. Gólis Range, with its prolongations east and west,
forms the seaward face of the high interior country, which is called
Ogo.</p>

<p>On the north Somáli coast there are harbours at Berbera and Zeila,
an uninhabited creek at Khor Kulangárit, near Zeila, and the open
roadstead of Bulhár, partially protected by a surf-beaten spit of sand,
which runs for a few hundred yards parallel to the beach, over which
at high tide small dhows can pass, but steamers have to anchor outside.</p>

<p>Berbera is built in two parts, three-quarters of a mile distant from
one another. To the east is the native town, composed of a few Arab
rubble buildings, a fort, and a large number of permanent Somáli huts
of matting and poles (called <i>agal</i>). These huts are divided by streets,
the different blocks of building space being allotted to the respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
Somáli tribes, clans, and families. Three-quarters of a mile to the
west is the new or official town, originally built by the Egyptians, the
houses being of rubble masonry, in one story, with flat roofs. There is
a good pier.</p>

<p>Berbera harbour, which is an excellent one, and the best to be
found either on the north or east Somáli coast, is formed by a sand
spit, similar to that at Bulhár, but rising above high-water mark. It
starts from the native town and runs west for two miles till well beyond
the official town. Inside this spit large steamers are well protected.
On the shore, nearly three miles west of the new town, is a good
lighthouse, built by the Egyptians before the British Government took
over the north Somáli coast from them. Clearing the point of the
sand spit it marks the entrance to the harbour. The water-supply is
obtained from a spring near the old Egyptian fort of Dubár, eight miles
inland under the Maritime Ranges, the water being brought over the
Maritime Plain in pipes.</p>

<p>The plain immediately round Berbera is covered with white pebbles
and devoid of bushes; a mile or two inland it becomes sandy and
covered with a flat-topped mimósa, which is called <i>khansa</i>, growing
here to a height of about three feet. There are also scattered thorn
bushes about twelve feet high. The plain round Berbera has been
greatly denuded of bush for firewood since 1885. I have watched
this denudation gradually going on year after year, and have attributed
it to the increased traffic since the British have been at Berbera, and
to the fact that the town is now well populated all the year round,
giving the bush no chance of recovering after the trade season is over.
In the Maritime Ranges there are gaps, through which can be seen the
towering blue line of Gólis. At a distance of about twenty miles east
and west of Berbera the Maritime Ranges come down to within a mile
or two of the sea, receding again at Bulhár to form a semicircle of hills
with a radius of fourteen miles; then towards Zeila the Maritime Plain
widens to thirty or forty miles.</p>

<p>This town is one hundred and seventy miles north-west of Berbera
by the coast caravan track, and consists of one compact town of mat
huts, with about fifty substantial Arab buildings. There is, strictly
speaking, no harbour, but vessels lying off the place are protected by
small islands to the north and west. The site of Zeila is low, and at
high spring-tides it is almost an island. Water for the use of the town
is carried in goatskins from Tukusha, three miles to the west.</p>

<p>For a mile or two inland the Zeila Maritime Plain is a desert of
smooth sand, then there is a strip of low evergreen bush, and behind
this a great open grass plain or <i>ban</i>, intersected by many dry river-beds,
fringed with tamarisks and acacias. Travelling across this plain in 1890,
my brother described it in his Journal as follows: “Except one or two
low hills there is nothing to break the broad sheet of dull yellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
merging into blue haze on the horizon, here and there divided into
light and dark patches by the shadows of the drifting clouds.”</p>

<p>This prairie rises to Eilo and Bur-ád Ranges to the south, thirty-five
or forty miles inland, and stretches away to the north-west along the
foot of the Tajurra Mountains nearly to the French settlement of Obok.
Between Obok and Zeila is another settlement created by the French,
called Jibúti, which within the last three or four years has risen into
notice. The site is a promontory of coral rock, and there is a good
harbour and a pier. The French are working hard to develop the place,
in order if possible to make it compete with Zeila as a trade port.</p>

<p>At Bulhár, forty-two miles west of Berbera by the coast track, the
Ayyal Yunis sub-tribe of the Habr Awal settle during the trading
season, from November to April. At this time both Berbera and
Bulhár are surrounded by the karias, or temporary kraals of the halted
trading caravans, and these karias stretch far out into the Maritime
Plain; but from May to October the town is nearly empty, a detachment
of police being kept there as a guard. The Bulhár Plain is a vast
expanse of bush, surrounded by blue mountains, and viewed from the
sea, with the long line of white beach in the foreground, is very striking.
Two very notable landmarks well known to sailors are Elmas Mountain,
thirteen miles west of Bulhár, and Laba Gumbur Mado (the “two
black hills”), twenty-five miles east of Berbera. Elmas rises to about
1500 feet, and is a cluster of bold peaks.</p>

<p>The Maritime mountains are composed principally of limestone, and
some of them are nearly as barren-looking as the volcano at Aden.
Here and there they are cut through by river-beds like the <i>wádi</i> of
Arabia, water percolating slowly, hidden at various depths below a
glaring expanse of dry powdery sand. Sometimes it is so near the
surface that the sand is moist, and water can be got by scraping out a
hole with the hands, though generally it is obtained by digging the <i>lás</i>,
or shallow pit, through the surface sand.</p>

<p>However inviting these smooth stretches of sand may appear, a
camp should never be pitched in the main channel. On a dozen
different occasions, after heavy rain in the hills, I have seen a yellow
flood, two to four feet deep and fifty yards wide, rush foaming down
the dry channel of the Issutugan with great speed, rolling down in
front of it a mass of branches, débris, and large boulders, and undermining
the high perpendicular banks, pieces of which would drop
into the river with a loud splash. At such a time the whole of the river-bed
in front of the freshet has been absolutely dry, untouched by water
perhaps for months. These freshets dwindle to a trickling stream in
about six hours, and may cease to flow in two days. The water does
not always reach the sea, as the dry loose sand of the Maritime Plain
drinks it up. After one of these floods has run itself away a thin
layer of mud remains deposited, which dries, cracks, and curls up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
small flakes, to be swept away in a few days by the wind, leaving the
surface of the sand again exposed.</p>

<p>At Bulhár, when there has been particularly heavy rain in the hills,
the Issutugan comes sweeping down over twenty miles of river-bed and
plain, and reaching the coast makes a clear cut through the high bank
behind the sea-beach. When the river dries the sea-bank is again in
the course of time silted up by the surf to its original height. At ordinary
times the water of the Issutugan, which is a typical <i>tug</i> or Somáli sand-river,
loses itself in the sand at So-Midgán, twenty-three miles inland
from Bulhár, and sinking deep down below the Maritime Plain, collects
behind the sea-bank, where it can be reached by digging.</p>

<p>Vast numbers of shallow pits, which render riding rather dangerous
at night, are seen at intervals along the coast between Bulhár and Zeila.
They contain water which is brackish, but drinkable. After being used
for some time the well deepens, striking through the layer of fresh water
into the underlying sea-water, and a new pit has to be dug. Where the
Issutugan cuts through the Maritime hills, which it does for forty miles
of its course, there is generally a tiny rivulet of water running along
the centre of its bed, now and then sinking out of sight, to reappear
again a mile or two below, the sand saturated with water held in suspension,
forming awkward although not dangerous quicksands.</p>

<p>The aspect of the Maritime mountains is very forbidding. Bare
precipices rise everywhere, or the hills form great rounded shoulders,
having a surface of gravel sprinkled over with a wretched scrub of
little brown bushes a foot high, which are generally dry as tinder.
Between Berbera and Bulhár the mountains come closer to the sea,
and take the form of low, table-topped plateaux of black trap rock,
with fringing precipices about thirty feet deep, and a steep talus slope
of débris dropping three hundred feet to the level of the river-beds
which cut through these plateaux. Hegebo, near Berbera, is a typical
plateau of this kind, and on the Zeila side of the British Protectorate
this sort of ground covers an enormous area. On the top of the
plateaux the surface has the appearance of having been rained upon by
showers of black stones. Here and there tufts of feathery grass grow
in the crevices, and there is light, open jungle of flat-topped thorn
bushes. Everywhere there are boulders and jagged or rounded pieces
of rock, so that where there are no paths caravans cannot go. The sun
beating down on the polished black surfaces causes great heat, and distresses
the baggage animals, and the stones are very trying to horses’
feet, even camels going better over them. The sand-rivers find their
way through these plateaux from the high mountains to the sea, forming
deep gullies, the expanse of sand and green bush below contrasting
strangely with the black frowning heights on either side.</p>

<p>Between the Maritime mountains and the great Gólis Range are
elevated, undulating, interior plains, intersected by river-beds and ravines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
running generally from south to north. These slope up in continuation
of the Maritime Plain, but present greater variety of scenery; here a
strip of gravel and rocky ground scantily dotted with low mimósa bushes,
and cut up by torrent-beds choked with rough boulders and a tangle
of savage thorns, there a wide sand-river winding through a belt of thick
forest of the beautiful <i>gudá</i> or larger thorn-tree, with a dense undergrowth
of pointed aloes, making it impossible to move about except in
the sheep and game paths. Narrow strips of thorn bushes and dark
green poison trees (<i>wabé</i>) wind down from the mountains, marking the
tributary watercourses. The river-beds themselves consist of broad,
flat, sandy reaches between alluvial banks, which have been scarped
perpendicularly, at alternate points on the right and left, where the
swirling water has undermined them with an inward sweep. Large
<i>gudá</i> trees grow closely together at the edge of the steep or overhanging
banks, their branches being covered with long drapery of <i>armo</i>
creepers, which hang down, often as much as thirty feet, to the level of
the river-bed below. Behind the jungle which fringes the banks is high
grass, until the ground rises, when the red soil, exposed by the action
of the rains, is worked into miniature hills and valleys. Here and
there at the side or in the centre of the channel is a clump of thorn-trees,
round which the sand has been washed up into a bank, and
masses of driftwood are heaped round the lower branches. Between
the parallel sand-rivers of the interior plains are watersheds of stony
ground, very trying to travel over, the sunbeams beating down on the
stony path, glittering on the points of the aloes, and being reflected like
fire from the thousands of chipped rocks, scattered pieces of quartz,
feldspar, and mica which everywhere crop above the surface.</p>

<p>Two days’ march due south of Berbera, having crossed the interior
plains, we arrive at the higher mountains, rising to nearly 6900 feet.
Gólis is the collective name, though Somális have a name for each flat-topped
bluff, as Daar-áss (Red clay), Gán-Libah (Lion hand), Ban-yéro
(Little plain), and Dig-wein (Big ears). In fact, in Somáliland every
watering-place, hill, or mound, and many a prominent tree, has some
descriptive name known to all the local tribes.</p>

<p>The Gólis Range forms a gigantic step rising abruptly on the
northern or coast face, and presenting to the sea, thirty-five miles distant,
great scarped precipices and bold descents, long walls of perpendicular
rock, red, yellow, or gray in colour, fringing the summit for many
miles. The whole interior of Somáliland presents the appearance of
having, in some great movement of the earth’s crust, been elevated from
the level of Guban, an abrupt break or fault occurring at Gólis Range,
which seems to have been upheaved for about six thousand feet; while
at Hargeisa the country is crumpled up into a chaos of hills, Guban
rising gradually into Ogo in several successive steps instead of in
one great fault. On the Hargeisa side the country between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
levels of Guban and Ogo is called Ogo-Gudan. At the base of the
fringing precipices, which are two or three hundred feet high, vast
tumbled masses of rock which have slipped from the crest lie heaped
together half buried among the foliage of tall cedar-trees and a profusion
of forest growth, forming caves and moss-grown recesses with great
variety of wild flowers, and clumps of maiden-hair fern growing in the
damp crevices of the rocks. The soil is a rich black vegetable mould.</p>

<p>There can be no greater contrast than that between this fine
mountain country and the brown sterile shores of the Gulf of Aden.
Often as one looks down from the top of Gólis the whole of Guban is
hidden from view by an immense expanse of white cloud lying below,
resembling a storm-tossed sea, the tops of Deimoleh-Wein and other
detached hills rising like islands above it. The air is so clear in the
elevated interior that from a hill in the Eilo Range, above Zeila, I have
recognised each separate bluff of Gólis at a distance of one hundred
and twenty miles. In these hills the roar of a lion or the alarm note
of a koodoo antelope can be heard echoing up the gorges for great
distances.</p>

<p>On the northern slope, at about a thousand feet below the level of the
crest of Gólis, is a ledge of broken ground, a mile or two wide, running
parallel to the range for twenty or thirty miles. It is called Mirso, or
“The Haven,” and is a favourite pasture of the Habr Awal and Habr
Gerhajis tribes, and also good ground for koodoo. It is covered with
jungle, but the soil is shallow and stony. A gigantic blue-green cactus,
or euphorbia, called <i>hassádan</i>, grows here to a height of about forty
feet, and gives a very dense shade. The sap is a white milky liquid,
which pours from every cut in the tree, and if caught in cups and
dried, it solidifies into a kind of rubber. The top of the range is
covered with dense jungle of mountain cedar. In the gorges some of
these trees, called <i>dayeb</i>, grow tall and straight, often four feet in
diameter at the foot, and over a hundred feet high; but more frequently
the <i>dayeb</i> forest is of comparatively stunted growth, being about forty
feet high, with the trunks and branches much bent and twisted. The
best trees which I saw were under Daar-áss Bluff, near Kulméye in
Mirso, and on Wagar Mountain, farther east.</p>

<p>From the crest of Gólis the country slopes towards the south-east,
falling gently towards the interior, the cedar forests ceasing at a distance
of about six miles inside the crest, and opening out into grassy downs
or thorn-covered wilderness. Soon, as we pass through Ogo, the Haud
waterless country, from one hundred to two hundred and fifty miles
across, is reached; and on its farther edge the ground again drops
slightly, as at Milmil, into Ogádén, the broad broken surface of Ogádén
finally sloping into the valley of the Webbe Shabéleh or Leopard river,
beyond which is the Juba. Where the Haud Plateau drops at Milmil
the limestone surface, which is covered with red soil, breaks up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
flat-topped hills, which continue the level of the Haud, but cease a little
farther south. They are covered with high <i>durr</i> grass, and form some
of the most favourite retreats for lions. Thus the Gólis Range and its
prolongations east and west are the most prominent natural feature in
Northern Somáliland, forming the watershed between Ogo, the high
cool country, and Guban, the arid coast belt. Guban is drained by
sand-rivers and ravines, which, starting in Gólis, pass through the interior
plains and cut through the Maritime Ranges, the water being eventually
lost under the Maritime Plain, to reappear near the surface behind the
sea-shore. I consider the whole of the Guban country to be almost
valueless, except as a pasture for sheep and goats, as it is only upon
reaching the high country that the soil is found to be fertile.</p>

<p>The Haud is the great elevated wilderness which separates Ogádén
and Harar from Ogo, Guban, and the coast. The Somáli word <i>haud</i>
is used to describe a peculiar kind of country, consisting of thick and
sometimes impenetrable thorn jungle, broken up by shallow watercourses,
and generally having an undergrowth of <i>hig</i> or <i>dár</i> aloes. The great
waterless plateau which is generally called the Haud is really a
district, and besides the variety of ground usually called <i>haud</i>, it includes
large strips of open, rolling, grass plains called <i>ban</i>, or, to the south-east,
semi-desert country called <i>aror</i>. <i>Ban</i> is the Somáli term for an open
plain absolutely, or nearly devoid of bushes.</p>

<p>In the wooded parts of the Haud dense thorn jungles alternate
with small glades of <i>durr</i> grass six feet high, luxuriating in beautiful
feathery clumps, with a level red soil; ant-hills crop up at about every
hundred yards, their pinnacles often rising to twenty-five feet. Some
of the dead thorn-trees are to be seen standing half eaten by white ants,
and the débris of fallen ones are found scattered about half-buried in
the soil, where they have been swept along by sheets of water during
the last rains. The remains of <i>galól</i> bushes attain an almost iron hardness,
and many a wound have I and my followers received at night by
stumbling against a <i>gori</i>, or jagged stump, half hidden in the high grass.
There is excellent pasture in the glades and between the bushes, the
Haud pastures being considered better than those of Ogo or Guban.
Extensive tracts of fertile soil, of good depth, are to be found at about
five thousand feet elevation, which, although, except at one or two mullah
villages, none of them are under cultivation, owing to the nomadic life
of the people, may yet in the distant future become very valuable. The
rainfall in the higher parts of the country is ample, and the water would
only require to be stored in tanks, as is done in the drier parts of India,
to ensure a supply all the year round. Of course for three months in
the dry season the whole of the soil is baked hard by the sun, but the
same thing occurs in India. In June, when there is a hot wind at the
coast, cool breezes blow over the elevated Haud, making it possible to
march all day long; and although in the sun it is hot, yet in a tent pitched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
under the shade of a flat-topped <i>gudá</i> tree it is sometimes quite chilly,
even at midday, while it is disagreeably so in the early mornings.</p>

<p>The Haud was first crossed by Mr. F. L. James and his party in
the winter of 1884-85, and a description of the journey is given in his
book, <cite>The Horn of Africa</cite>. Their camels were carrying loads for thirteen
days without touching a drop of water. The description of the Haud
in the above-named work, although I believe it to be an accurate portrait
of the country passed over by that expedition, does not give any idea
of the pleasant coolness and apparent fertility of the more elevated
North-eastern Haud. Mr. James’s party crossed this district at almost
its widest part, and in the <i>Jilál</i> or driest season. The plateau is
traversed by several <i>warda</i>, or great trade routes, to the far interior from
the coast, generally running nearly north and south. In the strips of
<i>ban</i>, or open plain, often many miles wide, all caravan paths are lost,
each caravan crossing independently of landmarks, and no impression
is left on the growing grass. Once the <i>ban</i> is passed, however, all tracks
will have converged into one well-worn path, or group of parallel paths.
One of the most important of these is the Warda Gumaréd crossing the
plateau from Hargeisa to Milmil.</p>

<p>The drainage from the Haud and Ogádén finds its way into the
Nogal Valley, or into the Webbe Shabéleh, eventually falling into the
Indian Ocean on the east Somáli coast, which is assigned to the Italian
sphere of influence. In reality, the Shabéleh, I believe, does not
actually reach the ocean, but falls into marshes near Mukdisha
(Magadoxo). Farther south, beyond the Webbe Shabéleh and the
Webbe Ganána or Juba, is the Tana River, rising near Mount Kenia
in the Masai country and flowing east. The Somális make annual
raids as far south as the Tana, to within a few days’ march of Lamu on
the east coast, but, as far as we know at present, the permanent Somáli
country may be considered to lie well to the north of the Juba. Most
of this river lies in Gállaland, and its sources have been scarcely
touched by any European explorer, except, perhaps, by the Italian
explorer Captain Bottigo.</p>

<p>I have said that some of the highest ground in Somáliland is the
great upheaval of Gólis, continuations of which stretch far away to the
eastward, parallel to the sea-shore as far as Cape Guardafui, forming
the bold, almost unexplored coast line which is visible from the decks of
steamers passing along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. But
there is a still higher mountain system, that of the Harar Highlands,
up to the foot of which the Haud Plateau extends. The Haud gradually
falls towards the south-east, and rises ever higher the farther one
goes westward, its north-west angle being occupied by the high <i>ban</i>
known as the Marar Prairie. This magnificent expanse of open grass
land is fifty-six miles long by thirty-five broad, having an area of nearly
one thousand square miles, and an elevation ranging from 4900 feet to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
6300 feet. There are a few grassy knobs like the Subbul hills which
rise singly out of the plains to nearly 7000 feet above sea-level.</p>

<p>In the <i>Jilál</i> season the Marar Prairie is a sheet of yellow grass,
quite dried up, but still containing nourishment—the varieties being
chiefly <i>darémo</i>, <i>dihe</i>, and <i>durr</i>, all three having valuable fattening
qualities for horses or camels. After the first rains the young grass
begins to come up in patches of vivid green, the old, longer grass falls,
and soon the plains are entirely covered with a carpet of rich green
turf, short and crisp, inviting a gallop, and having almost the appearance
of unlimited English pasture. The soil is red and powdery. Some of
our camps on the plains were between 6000 and 7000 feet above sea-level.
The country is probably similar to the South African veldt, the
great elevation in a measure compensating for the nearness to the equator.</p>

<p>There is heavy rainfall, the Marar Prairie partaking of that of Harar
and Abyssinia, but the water sinks to a great depth, so that with the exception
of temporary rain-pools the surface is waterless. There are, however,
many permanent watering-places in the jungle-covered hills and broken
ground bordering the prairie to the north and west, and in the Harar Highlands,
whose lofty summits can be seen overlooking the western edge of
the plain, some of them rising to over 10,000 feet. The Somális say
there is sometimes ice on these mountains, and that people die of cold.</p>

<p>The Marar Prairie supports enormous masses of game, and I have
had many a good day’s sport upon it, which will never be forgotten.
Although this is the largest <i>ban</i> which we have actually circumscribed
and measured, it may not be larger than many others in unexplored
parts of Somáliland, but is probably the best in quality. Some of the
low-lying <i>ban</i>—as, for instance, that of the Zeila Maritime Plain—is of
very poor quality, and this is partly why the Esa is not a mounted tribe.
I am told by Dolbahanta tribesmen whom I have taken to Marar, that
there are similar elevated plains at the back of the unexplored
Warsingali country. There are many other fine patches of <i>ban</i> in the
Haud which have been explored by us, as at Aror and Toyo.</p>

<p>My brother, while passing through the Esa country, wrote in his
Journal: “After leaving Doleimalleh we came across a strip of plain which
seemed to afford an example of the manner in which the <i>ban</i> is formed.
There were miles upon miles of dead and bleached thorn-trees, about
twenty feet high, evidently vigorous some ten years ago. These had either
been killed by very heavy floods, as the ground is flat and water does
not drain off easily, or they had been destroyed by extensive fires.
Among these trees were scores of red ant-hills, eight or ten feet high,
and many of the dead trees were overwhelmed by them, just a branch
or the part of a trunk projecting here and there. When the trees have
all been eaten the termites no doubt leave, and their mounds are
washed away by rain and wind, leaving behind only a vast grassy plain.”</p>

<p>The extreme north-western angle of the Marar Prairie is marked by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
a hill called Sarir Gerád, and from its base the ground falls abruptly to
the north into the Harrawa Valley in the Gadabursi country, and to the
west into deep gorges which lead towards Gildessa. The bushes cling
in a sharply-defined line to the rugged hills of denudation into which
the high prairie breaks up. The general formation of these hills is
mountain limestone, much eroded in the ravines by the chemical action
of water, and weathered into holes and caves, lined with deposits of
stalactite. Some of the torrents which descend to the east of Sarir cut
through deep alluvial deposits, leaving overhanging earth banks eighty
to one hundred feet deep. The whole of this wild and mountainous
region is very remarkable and picturesque, and the more interesting to a
sportsman because, together with the Harrawa Valley, it is still visited at
the right season by two or three herds of elephants. The average elevation
of this valley is about 5000 feet above sea-level, and it has deep alluvial
soil cut up by ravines with perpendicular banks. The vegetation is very
luxuriant, the predominating kind being the <i>hassádan</i> or euphorbia,
which here grows to a height of from thirty to sixty feet. There is a great
variety of flowers, and the grass is excellent in this valley, which stretches
away several days’ journey into the Esa country.</p>

<p>It can be well understood in a country of such an extended area, and
varying so much in elevation, that a large variety of plants and trees
exists; and in addition to the vegetation already noticed there are many
bushes and trees which one learns to recognise in the course of a
journey. It is of course impossible to mention them all, but the following
are a few of the most conspicuous:—</p>

<p>The most thorny of all the bushes I consider to be the <i>billeil</i>.
This horrible bush grows to a height of about ten feet, and is covered
with small curved hooks of great strength which cannot be disregarded.
The <i>sockso</i>, <i>adad</i>, <i>galól</i>, <i>khansa</i> are other more or less thorny bushes
which are met with everywhere. The <i>adad</i> produces the best gum-arabic
(<i>hábag</i>), large transparent knobs the size of a pigeon’s egg being
visible in the joints of the branches. The <i>galól</i> is a twisted, straggling,
and untidy-looking thorn-tree, growing to a height of fifteen to twenty-five
feet, the root being used for hardening and making watertight the
bark <i>háns</i> or water-vessels used by Somáli caravans. The branches
have very little strength, and are useless for building platforms in when
watching for game. There are thorns over an inch long, each springing
from a white bulb.</p>

<p>The jungles in Ogádén chiefly consist of the <i>galól</i> and the <i>khansa</i>.
The giant euphorbia called <i>hassádan</i> grows in the hills and in the
Haud, seldom much above or below five thousand feet. The <i>derkein</i>
is a tree allied to the <i>hassádan</i>, but it is found at a lower elevation,
and is very common in the Dolbahanta country, growing in thick compact
groves, and within these groves it is the custom of the natives to
bury their dead. Two large thorn-trees of great beauty are the <i>gudá</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
and the <i>wádi</i>. The <i>gudá</i> has a dark stem and grows to a height of from
thirty to fifty feet, spreading out to an umbrella top and giving excellent
shade. The <i>wádi</i> has a whitish stem and spreads out like the <i>gudá</i>,
but more symmetrically, and is ornamented with white thorns about
five inches long. The <i>kedi</i> and the <i>mégag</i> are conspicuous trees.
The <i>kedi</i> grows without a branch for about eight feet, and then breaks
out into a compact rounded mass of long, green, soft thorns, growing one
out of the other, in the same way as a prickly pear. The <i>mégag</i> is much
the same in shape, but there are no thorns, and it breaks out into small
twisted branches, matted together, with tiny blue-gray leaves. Another
tree is the <i>garas</i>, having leaves like a laurel, while the roots and bifurcations
of the stems contain deep recesses which often hold drinking
water after rain. The <i>wabé</i>, or dark green poison-tree, is very common
in the mountains, a concoction of arrow-poison being made from the
roots. The <i>athei</i> is a small bush with gray leaves, the twigs of which
form the native substitute for a toothbrush in Somáliland. <i>Ergin</i> is a
slender, green, grass-like bush of the cactus kind, with a milky sap, which
forms dense cover and is often the resort of leopards. <i>Dár</i> and <i>hig</i>,
the latter of which produces excellent rope-fibre, are varieties of the
aloe, and cover enormous areas. There is no ground more favoured
by the lesser koodoo.</p>

<p>Of the largest trees the most conspicuous are the <i>darei</i>, a fig-tree,
and the <i>gób</i>, a very large thorny tree growing on the banks of river-beds,
with edible berries of an orange colour, the size of a cherry, and
containing a large stone. In taste they resemble apples, and are
delicious eating. The <i>tomaiyo</i> is a root like a knotted swede, growing
three inches below the surface in the soft red soil of the Haud and
Ogádén. It is green and purple outside, and inside consists of a white
watery pulp which will allay thirst. This plant is difficult to find, and
has to be burrowed for. <i>Armo</i>, a vividly green creeper with large, fleshy,
heart-shaped leaves, covers all the trees by the river-beds, hanging
festooned like a curtain, and turning the <i>gudá</i> thorn-trees into natural
shady bowers. Of the three best grasses already mentioned as growing
in the Haud, the <i>durr</i> grows to about six feet, the <i>darémo</i> to about
fifteen inches, and <i>dihe</i> to about four inches. All these grasses curl
and twist about very much, the <i>durr</i> spreading out into branches like
a bush. The favourite cover chosen by a lion is in nine cases out of
ten either <i>durr</i> grass, <i>khansa</i> forest, or the reeds (<i>alálo</i>) growing at
the margin of a river-bed.</p>

<p>The Somáli climate is on the whole very dry and bracing, and there
is no malarial fever to speak of except on the Webbe Shabéleh river.</p>

<p>In the Maritime hills the highest shade temperature I have registered
is 118° Fahr. at midday, and on the cool elevated Haud country the temperature
just before sunrise has often been as low as 56° in June. The
lowest temperature I ever registered was 49°.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>During the months of July, August, and September 1892, my
brother took daily five or six observations with barometer and thermometer.
The following shade temperatures, taken at random from
his tables, may be of interest:—</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX_III">APPENDIX III<br />
<span class="smcap">Notes on Somáli Trade</span></h2>

<p>The manufactured goods which the African wants, and the raw material
which he can export, are much the same all over the countries of tropical
Africa. But Somáliland has one great advantage as a trading country
over many other African regions. Trade caravans depend for their
transport upon camels, not upon human beings; and these camels,
although comparatively weak, are vastly superior to those of many other
camel countries, in that they cost only about £2 each and pick up all
their food by the wayside. A comparison of the cost of camel transport
in Somáliland with the human transport on the Zanzibar coast
will show the former to great advantage.</p>

<p>The calculation which follows is based on my own experience of
both countries. It is some years since I was at Mombasa, so I am
open to correction if the prices there have been recently reduced.</p>

<p>The Zanzibar coast porter carries a 60 lb. load of merchandise
and a few days’ rations, and costs about £1 per month in pay and
food. Thus six porters would carry 360 lbs. of merchandise for a
three months’ journey at a cost of £18.</p>

<p>Two camels would be bought at Berbera for £4, and after a long
journey, and allowing for a percentage of loss by death, they would
fetch, if sold by the Somáli owners, about £3. With the two camels
would be one attendant, and his pay and rations for three months would
involve an outlay of about £3:15s. The camels, if lightly laden, would
carry 275 lbs. each; and the merchandise they would carry, if the
liberal allowance of 63 lbs. be deducted for the weight per month of
the attendant’s rations, would be 360 lbs., or the same as that carried by
the six porters.</p>

<p>The cost of the two camels and their attendant for the three months
would, however, amount to only £4:15s. as against the £18 for the
porters.</p>

<p>During one of my last journeys we carried rations of rice, dates,
and ghee at 1¾ lb. per man for a period of four and a half months.
This could never be done by a caravan of Swahili porters, who can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
only carry a few days’ rations in addition to the load. Serious hardships
from want of food are practically impossible when travelling with
camels. In comparing porters and camels it must be borne in mind
that the Somáli caravans go from Berbera to Imé, four hundred miles,
in sixteen days, which is faster travelling than could be accomplished
by Swahili porters for the same length of road.</p>

<p>Of all the Somáli coast ports by far the most promising is Berbera.
Without counting the great capacity of Somáliland itself as a consumer
of our fabrics, which I shall touch upon later, Berbera has many
advantages which will, I feel sure, cause it to become very valuable as
<i>entrepôt</i> and distributer to countries and tribes outside the existing
sphere of British influence. If the resources of Central Africa are
destined ever to be fully developed, I believe Berbera will be one of the
chief outlets for Central African exports.</p>

<p>The position of Berbera is unique. The meat supplies for Aden
come almost entirely from there, and freight is always obtainable.
Already two, and sometimes three, coasting steamers call weekly at
Berbera, to say nothing of the freights carried by dhows. Berbera is
close to one of the greatest lines of shipping in the world, and when
trade develops into direct communication, the proximity of Europe and
India cannot fail to attract capital. Another advantage which Berbera
has over the ports of the East African coast is that the long sea-voyage,
with its dangerous Cape Guardafui and its uncertain currents, is avoided;
and although the land distance to Uganda and the Equatorial Province
is greater than from Mombasa, Somáliland has, in Aden, a base secure
from all attack, and is a week closer than Mombasa to England and
India. I have already shown the advantage of camel transport in the
Hinterland of the Somáli coast. The route to Central Africa, at any
rate as far as Imé, four hundred miles inland, is an excellent one, presenting
no difficulties to caravans, either owing to physical causes or the
temper of the natives; and, moreover, the whole of the country through
which it passes is exceptionally healthy.</p>

<p>The Gállas beyond Imé are camel-owners like the Somális, and live
much in the same way. The route is so good, for the first four hundred
miles at least from the coast, that at any time, should the trade of
Central Africa ever in the far distant future be sufficient to justify it, the
construction of a railway following it would be perfectly easy.</p>

<p>The following statistics I find published in a Calcutta paper, having
been taken from Lieutenant-Colonel Stace’s Official Report on Somáli
Coast Commerce, 1891-92: “The total value of the trade of Zeila
last year was over a quarter of a million sterling, exports figuring for
£151,721 of this sum. The exports consist almost exclusively of
coffee from Harar (valued last year at over £100,000), skins, and
hides; while their imports are piece goods (£12,508), rice (£31,827),
American shirtings (£17,941), Indian shirtings (£10,057), and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
<i>jowári</i> (£10,000). The total value of the trade of Berbera and
Bulhár last year was £280,664, of which imports are responsible for
£161,112. Berbera is supposed to contain about 30,000 people during
the principal trading season, Bulhár perhaps 5000, and Zeila 6000.”</p>

<p>There are many minor imports which do not compare in importance
with those named. Among the possible imports in the distant future
may figure common brown blankets. They are most popular as
presents, and might eventually, I should think, develop into an article
of trade.</p>

<p>Other chief exports at present, besides those already named, are—</p>

<ul>
<li>Gum,</li>
<li>Ostrich feathers,</li>
<li>Cattle and sheep (for the Aden market).</li>
</ul>

<p>The hides, the trade in which seems to me to be capable of great
development, go to America, whence most of the cotton goods are
imported.</p>

<p>Considering the capacity of Somáliland as a consumer of our fabrics,
our countrymen’s lack of enterprise in having allowed American goods
to gain the ascendancy in this market seems astonishing. Among the
future possible exports of value are the fibre of the <i>hig</i> or pointed aloe,
certain barks for tanning leather, and other natural products. Ivory
at present mostly goes to ports west of Zeila, and does not figure
largely in the exports from the British Protectorate. Now that the
Eastern Soudan is closed, the gum of Somáliland should be important.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of resin and of gum, the best gum being that
of the <i>adad</i>, a low-spreading thorn-tree, exuding from the branches of
which can be seen transparent knobs of the gum of a golden hue, the
size of a lemon, and pleasant to taste. It is much eaten by the natives
and by gazelles. Gum-pickers take it to their squalid-looking encampments,
and loading camels with the sacks, they take them to the coast
for sale.</p>

<p>An instance of this is the horror of dogs. I have seen a Somáli, when thinking
himself unobserved, playing with a pariah dog; but if a Somáli servant, in a house at
Aden, when waiting at table, should be brushed against by a perfectly clean English
fox-terrier, he will as likely as not drop the dish which he is carrying, and say that he has
been bitten. All this horror is acted for the benefit of the other servants.</p>

were Gállas, but in the Somáli language every one not a Mussulman is called Gál, or

evening camp after dark, and to throw off the loads and let the camels rest at night on
an empty stomach. A continued course of such treatment will kill the best camels.
When camels “flop” down on arriving in camp, or “swear” very much on being loaded,
it is a sure sign they are being overworked. With good pasturage and proper working
hours, I have often seen fifty camels loaded up almost in silence.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The first treaty between the British Government and the Somális was signed in 1827
after the plundering of an English ship by the Habr Awal. In 1840 another was signed
with the chiefs of Zeila and Tajurra. In 1865 Sir Richard Burton’s expedition was
attacked at Berbera, and the blockade which followed was raised on the signing of another
treaty. In 1866 treaties were made with the Habr Gerhajis, Habr Toljaala, and
Midjerten; and since 1884, when the Egyptians handed over the coast to Great Britain,
treaties have been made with all the northern tribes. By an agreement signed in 1888,
the boundary separating the British and French Protectorates begins near Loyi-ada, on
the coast between Jibúti and Zeila, and runs by Abbaswein, Biyo-Kabóba, Gildessa,
towards Harar.</p>

<p>On 5th May 1894 a protocol was signed, fixing the boundaries of the Italian and
British spheres of influence. The boundary-line starts from Gildessa, and, following the
eighth parallel of north latitude, skirts the north-eastern border of the territories inhabited
by the Géri, Bertiri, and Rer Ali tribes, leaving Gildessa, Jig-Jiga, and Milmil within the
Italian sphere of influence. The line then follows latitude 8° north as far as its intersection
with the forty-eighth meridian of east longitude, and thence to the intersection of
latitude 9° north, with longitude 49° east, along which it proceeds, terminating at the
coast.</p>

cattle trough at which the cattle are drinking, improvised out of a hide propped up with
sticks and stones, or in a hollow shaped with clay. Half the water is lost on the way up,
so it usually takes many hours to water the enormous herds.</p>

shooting elephants in Harrawa under the guidance of a son of Nur, the deposed Ugaz
of the Gadabursi tribe. When we passed through the Harrawa Valley a few days
later we were taken no notice of by Banagúsé or the Ugaz, who was living quite near
our route. The latter had professed himself an enemy to the British, and had been
intriguing with the Abyssinians, encouraging them to advance their influence into the
Gadabursi country, in the hope that by their help he would be reinstated at the head of
the tribe, ousting his brother Elmy, the present Ugaz.</p>

that the real cause was the bites of mosquitoes. These pests (called <i>Kan-ad</i>) are not
generally present in Eastern Somáliland, but are common at certain spots on the coast
between Berbera and Zeila, and on the Zeila-Harar routes, and in the Gadabursi country.
They are also found near the Webbe, and when there the tribes from Berbera, who are
not accustomed to mosquitoes, have a great dread of their bites, believing malarial fever
to be caused by them.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The following titles were explained to me by an Abyssinian, and, though I cannot
vouch for their accuracy of spelling, I jot them down:—</p>

<ul>
<li><i>Negúsa negest</i>, the Emperor; literally the “king of kings.”</li>
<li><i>Negús</i>, King.</li>
<li><i>Rás-Bitódet and Rás</i>, high titles ranking next to <i>Negús</i>.</li>
<li><i>Dejasmatch</i>, General of Division.</li>
<li><i>Kanyasmatch</i>, General of the Right.</li>
<li><i>Gerasmatch</i>, General of the Left.</li>
<li><i>Fi Taurari</i>, General of the Advance.</li>
<li><i>Balanbaras</i>, Commandant of a fortress.</li>
<li><i>Turk Basha</i>, General of Artillery.</li>
<li><i>Yeshi Alaka</i>, Chief of a thousand.</li>
</ul>

<p>The combined camp of a large Abyssinian army is so arranged that the Emperor and
various kings occupy the central camp. In front is that of several <i>Rás</i>, <i>Dejasmatch</i>,
and <i>Taurari</i>; to the right several <i>Rás</i>, <i>Dejasmatch</i>, and <i>Kanyasmatch</i>; to the left
several <i>Rás</i>, <i>Dejasmatch</i>, and <i>Gerasmatch</i>.</p>

<p>Some idea of Rás Makunan’s importance as Governor of Harar may be gained from
the fact that he has under him four <i>Dejasmatch</i>, eight <i>Balanbaras</i>, four <i>Kanyasmatch</i>,
nine <i>Gerasmatch</i>, and five <i>Fi Taurari</i>.</p>

<p>Any of the kings has apparently a chance of becoming Emperor. The present
Emperor, Menelek, is also King of Shoa.</p>

who can read and write, they have great respect for people who show nimbleness with a
pencil and note-book, and who can write even on horseback; they admire pictures and
photographs.</p>

<p>I was amused by their insisting that nearly every book I had was a “Frinji Bible”;
and not till I had shown them the illustrations in one of the supposed Bibles, which was
Gordon-Cumming’s <cite>Five Years’ Adventures in South Africa</cite>, did they realise that there
are books on every subject. They all beg for <i>hashi</i> (paper), Korans, and <i>tusbas</i>, and I
gave a score of mullahs two or three quires of white foolscap to divide between them.</p>

gadfly, the camels, whenever they were halted, throwing themselves down and rolling,
with the result that a great deal of kit was broken. There are two kinds—the <i>balaad</i>,
a small, grayish black fly the size of a common house-fly, with triangular wings, very
dangerous to camels, often causing eventual death; and the <i>dúg</i>, as large as a bumblebee,
which stings both men and animals, and is present in great numbers, only ceasing its
persecutions by night. It is not so dangerous to camels as <i>balaad</i>. I learned, on sending
specimens to be examined at the British Museum, that neither of these flies have anything
whatever to do with the “Tsetse” of South Africa, which belongs to an entirely different
family.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> These people are a great encumbrance in the movable karias of the nomads, and
if they stay there, unless they have relations who will befriend them, they soon die, or are
eaten up by the packs of hyænas which haunt the outskirts of the encampments at night.
In the hope of gaining a permanent sanctuary they travel painfully great distances to
the nearest mullah villages; hence the large number of cripples and sick that are to be

buy a sheep, and had quite given up all hope of getting mutton for my men, when one
was at last driven up to my tent; the owner of the sheep said he had heard I wanted
one, and that having been some distance off he could not come till now. I bought the
sheep for two pieces of cloth. Half an hour later its throat began to swell up, and my
men showed the marks where it had been bitten by an <i>abéso</i>, a very poisonous snake,
whilst grazing. Half an hour later it was dead, its neck having swollen to a tremendous
size. By this time, of course, the owner of the sheep had vanished!</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
